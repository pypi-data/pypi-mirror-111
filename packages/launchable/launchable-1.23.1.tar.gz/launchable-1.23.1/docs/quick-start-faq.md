# Quick start FAQ

## Challenges that Launchable helps with

### Key value proposition: Ship code faster by testing faster

Software development teams are under pressure to deliver code faster while maintaining high quality.

There are numerous approaches to help teams deliver code faster: building a CI pipeline, automating tests, continuously delivering code to production. However, none of these help address the problem that running tests \(long or short\) is the bottleneck in delivering software.

![Testing: Bottleneck slowing teams down](.gitbook/assets/testing-bottleneck-infinity.png)

Launchable's unique approach is to intelligently prioritize tests to cut down testing times without sacrificing quality. Developers get feedback much earlier in the development cycle.

> Launchable helps teams ship code faster by testing faster.

### Where does Launchable fit in your development pipeline?

Launchable is test cycle agnostic - point us to the test suites that cause the most pain in your delivery and we can help reduce the time it takes to run the tests and deliver feedback earlier.

#### How Launchable fits into your testing lifecycle?

You can add Launchable in two ways - either `Shift left`or `Shift right`. Think of `Shift left` as an approach to test for risks earlier by testing earlier \(typically by moving some nightly tests earlier\). Think of `Shift right` as an approach to provide fast feedback by shifting less important tests later \(typically tests run on each `git push`\). See [About Launchable](./#how-launchable-fits-into-your-testing-lifecycle) for detailed writeup.

#### Greenfield or Brownfield applications? Either works

Launchable helps in both use cases. Launchable requires that the test suite under consideration is running at a reasonable frequency \(multiple times per week versus once a month\).

The key question to ask yourself is "where are the developers seeing pain on long test times?"

The answer tends to be different for different teams. Some teams want to cut down long integration test cycle times \(from hours to minutes\); this typically is the case in brownfield applications. Others want to cut down unit test cycles for faster feedback to developers \(from 30 minutes to &lt;5-7 minutes\); this typically is the case in greenfield applications.

The key is to bring Launchable in as early as you can so that you can bring the benefits of shipping code faster earlier.
{% endhint %}

#### Microservices or Monoliths? Either works

A question with a similar flavor to "greenfield or brownfield applications" and with a similar answer. Launchable works equally well in both cases and solves similar challenges in both cases.

**Monoliths**: Teams with monoliths typically bring us in on the "nightly" test scenario. The team has accumulated a lot of tests over a period of time that cannot be run on every push. These teams look to shift left nightly tests to provide feedback to developers as early as possible. Some teams bring Launchable to help speed up unit or acceptance tests as the amount of tests have increased.

**Microservices**: Unit tests for individual microservices tend to run fast for most organization. However, integration testing scenario remains a challenge \(just as with monoliths\). Thus, teams typically bring us in to help with integration testing scenario. Teams that really care about faster dev loop on `git push` bring Launchable on the unit test side of the house.

### Where does Launchable _not_ help?

Manual tests: Tests where developers are testing the application by hand is where Launchable doesn't help.

#### What is the maturity in testing automation required? Or only _some_ of tests are automated, can Launchable help?

Yes we can. No team that we know has enough tests or enough testing automation. It is good to start with what you have and bring in Launchable - this helps improve feedback times early on and you continue to reap benefits as the automation matures.

Launchable helps in scenarios where tests are triggered automatically or by a human. We require that tests are being run with reasonable frequency \(think multiple times per week versus once a month\).

## Launchable's Approach and Impact

### What makes Launchable unique?

Launchable is focussed on finding the _**"needle in the haystack" for every change**_ to minimize test execution times. Launchable is based on an exciting Machine Learning based approach called [Predictive Test Selection](https://www.launchableinc.com/what-is-predictive-test-selection) that is being used by [Facebook](https://engineering.fb.com/2018/11/21/developer-tools/predictive-test-selection/) and Google. Predictive Test Selection is a branch of what is commonly known as [Test Impact Analysis](https://www.launchableinc.com/test-automation-glossary/test-impact-analysis).

Launchable is democratizing the Predictive Test Selection approach so that it is available to teams of all sizes at the turn of a key. In the absence of this practice, teams have to manually create subsets "smoke tests" or parallelize their tests \(note: Launchable speeds up existing smoke tests or parallelized tests too\).

### What impact can Launchable make?

The key component that helps Launchable learn well is that the test suite should be run with reasonable **frequency** and should have **some failures**.Typically, we have seen a reduction of 60-80% in test times without an impact on the quality.

The primary reason that teams like Manba \([see case study](https://www.launchableinc.com/customers/manba-reducing-test-runtime-for-a-ruby-on-rails-application)\) bring Launchable in is that we have enabled the team to ship code faster and push their changes through.

Larger teams have focussed on improving developer productivity times in addition to increasing software delivery velocity. See case studies of an [auto manufacturer](https://www.launchableinc.com/customers/reducing-slow-test-cycles-at-rocketcar-case-study) and a [Silicon Valley Unicorn](https://www.launchableinc.com/customers/a-silicon-valley-icon-reduces-slow-delivery-cycles-by-testing-faster-and-improves-developer-happiness-case-study) using Launchable.

## Trialing and using Launchable

### What is the effort required to bring in Launchable to my team?

You instrument your build script with 4 commands.

1. Send us information about the changes being tested
2. Call the subset command to receive the subset of tests from Launchable
3. Run your tests \(as you typically did\)
4. Send us information about test failures/successes so that we can train the model

We have built integrations to various test runners to make the process of interacting with us easy. Here is an example of how these commands look when using Maven.

![Using Launchable with Maven](.gitbook/assets/launchable-cli-3-.png)

The [Getting started](getting-started.md) guide will walk you through each step in detail.

### How long does it take to train the model?

Typically, it takes about 4 weeks to train the model for a test suite that is run with a reasonable frequency and has failures to learn from.

That said, you can start using Launchable from day 1 using the `--rest` option in the [CLI](resources/cli-reference.md#subset). Here, you are using Launchable to return a subset and the rest of the tests. You can then run both these with your test runner. As the model trains, the subset will start capturing more issues and ultimately where you can confidently remove the rest of the tests.

![Start using Launchable from day 1](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/CP29iMEIHNpIDZ5GLYM6FgY2YcLDJB3c4Kw2C5_DcWnSvjeKNCZESnfoUWDozkGNHameI70lQFKcxrMPFyN4zbZ9oEaiShzTFbNh5yfXCZT_f2YQ3V_ZM5yQuaMnIOezOfSZtAL4Hnc)

### Do you offer help in instrumenting the build script?

Most folks can get going very quickly. However, if you do want us to come in and talk to your team to help through with the instrumentation, reach out to our [sales](https://www.launchableinc.com/contact-sales) and we can set something up. You can also jump on our [discord community channel](https://www.launchableinc.com/community) and ask for help.

### Can I try Launchable?

Yes. We offer a free tier and free trial for small teams. If you work at a big company, we can help you through a POC. See more on the [pricing](https://www.launchableinc.com/pricing) page.

## Responses to key concerns from customers

Customer concerns fall into three buckets: concerns about testing, ML model and security.

### Concerns about testing

#### Am I testing less?

**Key Idea: You are testing more frequently** In short, the answer is no, teams tend to test more frequently with Launchable. When Launchable reduces testing times, that means that you can test faster and often teams will run more tests as a result. E.g: Say you can now run 10% of nightly tests, at this point, teams will change their pipeline to bring this 10% run as part of their PR process and consequently test more often.

#### What happens to the tests that are not run? This will surely impact quality!

**Key idea: Defensive runs** We ask our customers to view us as a way to speed tests and ship code faster. The tests that are not run as part of the subset, should be run as part of a **defensive** run. The defensive run captures any tests that escape through the subset. The defensive run is instrumented to send us the test rests and thus Launchable uses this run \(in addition to the subset\) to train the model.

### Concerns about the ML model

#### How often is the model trained?

The model is trained nightly.

#### Is the model shared between customers?

No. Each ML is customer specific.

#### How does the model learn about new code, new tests?

This question covers three scenarios \(outlined in the graphic below\).

**Scenario 1** : Existing code and existing tests

This is "business as usual" scenario i.e. either existing code or existing tests are modified. The model predicts the tests and uses the subset results and the defensive runs result to update itself to predict better the next time around.

**Scenario 2**: New code and new tests

This scenario is about when there is active new development happening and new tests are added at the same time. The model sees new tests and schedules them to be run because it doesn't know about them. The model then uses the data from this run and trains itself. From day 2, the model behaves as scenario 1 - initially, it may still get more wrongs than right because the codebase is new and thus the defensive runs become important to catch any issues that escape and train the model to perform better.

**Scenario 3**: New code and existing tests

This scenario is where new code is added but developers expect the existing tests to catch the issues. The model predicts the tests as in scenario 1. Note: if existing tests don't test for the new code, the model cannot do much about it - developers will need to first build the test cases to provide enough code coverage.

![Learning about new code and new tests](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/WAavOfTmEm6QteWSK5J-z-s2_Mvd7Y43gZ4t6DrAVoErBkSg_8pBzIHnAhPGj8SjvvPXYixwxKhR20dtvsES7LirBZuBfAa4_q6cRvr__Fdq3YPI3ObCe9FAhfwGF2ebb1LqKKOk3HY)

#### How many features do you use to train the model?

The answer is that it is continuously evolving. Our model today \(May 21\) looks at about 50+ features.

#### How do you evaluate the performance of a model?

We build a model performance curve. This curve is based on the actual data sent by the customer. We split the data into training and evaluation data to measure the performance of the model.

Here, the red line is the base line \(without Launchable\) from an actual customer. The base line shows that it takes about 75% tests to get to 90% confidence where confidence is the point where you found regressions. Thus, this customer finds 90% of issues after running 75% of the tests. In their case, the test run was about 1 hour so the test suite had to run about 45 minutes to get to 90% of issues.

The Launchable model \(blue line\) could get to the same 90% by running 20% of tests. Thus, the test suite ran about 10 minutes to find equivalent number of issues.

Thus, if the customer shifted tests left - they could run 10 minute runs multiple times a day and catch most of the issues. Any laggards would be found in the defensive runs.

For this customer, this productivity boost was equivalent to finding 8 new development resources for the year and 3x hardware impact.

### Concerns about Security

For details see our sections [data privacy and protection](security/data-privacy-and-protection.md), [security policies](security/information-security.md) and [data examples](security/data-examples.md).

### What data is sent over? Do you look into the code?

We don't look into the code itself to make decisions \(this is where our [Predictive Test Analysis - ML based approach](https://www.launchableinc.com/what-is-predictive-test-selection) is superior to static code analysis\). The information that is sent over is the **git commit graph** - this implies sending metadata about your source code changes. This metadata looks like files changed, the number of lines in the files that have been changed, test names and their results. Read more in [data examples](security/data-examples.md) section.

You can also call `--log-level audit` global option when you invoke the CLI to view exactly what data has passed in the request. See [CLI reference](resources/cli-reference.md#global-options).

The CLI itself is [open source](https://github.com/launchableinc/cli) so that security conscious organizations can inspect it if they choose to do so.

#### Does Launchable encrypt data?

Yes in transit and at rest.

#### Where can I find data privacy and protection policies?

See the [data privacy and protection](security/data-privacy-and-protection.md) document.

#### Where is the Launchable SaaS hosted? Is the SaaS multi-tenant?

The SaaS is hosted on AWS and is multi-tenant.

#### Where can I see Launchable security policies?

See the [security policies](security/information-security.md) document.

#### Where can I see your AWS policies?

Reach out to our [sales](https://www.launchableinc.com/contact-sales) to get a copy of our AWS policies.

#### I still have questions. Can you meet my infosec team?

Happy to do so. Reach out to our [sales](https://www.launchableinc.com/contact-sales) to help set a meeting with your infosec team.

## More questions?

### Do you sign NDAs?

We have no NDA requirements from our end, these requirements come from the customers. If your company requires to sign a NDA with a vendor, we are happy to work with you. We have our own NDA or can work with your teams NDA.

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you go the NDA route, we'd be remiss if we didn't point the following:

Most small teams \(or big\) can get started on our [free or Moon tier](https://www.launchableinc.com/pricing) without having to talk to us. So we'd encourage you to explore that option.

We can also meet up for an introduction meeting where we can chat to figure out if you have to sign an NDA to work with us.
{% endhint %}

### Launchable sounds great - can I ask you to evangelize to my team?

We would love to. We don't want you to own the burden of evangelizing us in your organization. We are often brought in by a champion to talk to their internal stakeholders. Reach out to [sales](https://www.launchableinc.com/contact-sales) to set a meeting up.

### Talk to a human?

We love talking to people who we can help. Reach out to our [sales](https://www.launchableinc.com/contact-sales) or jump on our [discord channel](https://www.launchableinc.com/community).
