Description: # Imraylib
        
        Integrates Imgui with Raylib.
        
        The integration does not directly connect Imgui with Raylib.
        This permits you to selectively filter events to prevent them being sent to Imgui.
        
        For example: if you had a number of different Imgui interfaces or possibly even
        one rendered inside a first-person game. You don't want them receiving events
        until the player begins interacting with the specific Imgui interface.
        
        If you don't care about this, there is a convenience function `send_all_events`
        which will send all Raylib data to Imgui and "just work".
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pip install imraylib`
        
        Until [raylibpy](https://github.com/overdev/raylib-py) merges the `raylibpy-3.7` branch to master,
        you must manually install it from Git.
        
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        * [raylibpy](https://github.com/overdev/raylib-py) - Specifically the `raylibpy-3.7` branch.
        * [raylib-py-flat](https://github.com/adamlwgriffiths/raylib-py-flat) - Simplifies `raylibpy` imports
        * [pyimgui](https://github.com/swistakm/pyimgui)
