Asynchronous Timer Library
==========================

`atimer` library implements asynchronous timer Python coroutine
based on POSIX timers. The coroutine can be used with Python `asyncio
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html>`_ module API.

The main features are

- timer expires at regular intervals
- track number of expirations if a long running task causes overrun
- start synchronized with system clock at the edge of an interval
- measure time while system is suspended

The library is tested with default `asyncio` event loop and its drop-in
replacement `uvloop <https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop>`_.  Use of
`uvloop` increases timer accuracy.

Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- Cython 0.29 or later

The `atimer` library is licensed under terms of GPL license, version 3, see
`COPYING <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>`_ file for details.

.. note:: The library is implemented on top of
   `timerfd <http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/timerfd_create.2.html>`_
   Linux kernel interface and uses `CLOCK_BOOTTIME` clock by default.
