Release Notes
=============

0.0.42
======

Released June 29, 2021.

- ``coiled.set_backend_options()`` now supports configuring your Coiled account to
  run in your own Google Cloud Plaform account.


0.0.41
======

Released June 9, 2021.

- New function ``coiled.set_backend_options()`` which allows users to set the options
  for an account (e.g., cloud provider, region, docker registry) from the Python
  client. Previously this was only available using the Coiled web application.
- Fixed a bug in ``coiled.performance_report()`` that was preventing performance data
  from being captured.
- Fixed an issue where an error building software environments could result in hanging
  client sessions.
- ``coiled.Cluster()``, ``coiled.start_job()``, ``coiled.create_software_environment()``,
  and ``coiled.create_notebook()`` can now take an optional ``environ`` dictionary as
  an argument, allowing users to pass in environment variables to clusters, jobs,
  software environments, and notebooks.  These environment variables are not encrypted,
  and so should not be used to store credentials or other sensitive information.
- ``coiled.list_core_usage()`` now shows additional information about how many credits
  your account has used for the current program period.
- ``coiled.Cluster()`` no longer raises a warning if no AWS credentials can be found,
  since a given cluster may not want or need to use them.


0.0.40
======

Released May 18, 2021.

- New functions ``coiled.performance_report()`` and ``coiled.list_performance_reports()``.
  ``coiled.performance_report()`` is a context manager which captures cluster computation
  as a dask performance report, uploads it to Coiled, and hosts it online for later viewing.
- New function ``coiled.get_notifications()`` returns notifications from resource
  creation steps in your chosen cloud provider. This can be useful in debugging when
  resources do not launch as intended.
- ``coiled.create_software_environment()`` now has an optional argument ``force_rebuild``,
  defaulting to ``False``, which forces a rebuild of the software environment, even
  if one matching the given specification already exists. There is a new corresponding
  flag ``--force-rebuild`` in the ``coiled env create`` command line command. 
- New functions ``coiled.cluster_logs()`` and ``coiled.job_logs()`` return logs from
  Coiled clusters and Coiled jobs, respectively. ``Cloud.logs()`` has been renamed to
  ``Cloud.cluster_logs()`` to better distinguish it from ``Cloud.job_logs()``.
- New function ``coiled.get_software_info()`` returns detailed information about a
  Coiled software environment specification.
- ``coiled.info()`` has been renamed to ``coiled.diagnostics()``, and now always returns
  JSON-formatted diagnostic information.
- New function ``coiled.list_user_information()`` provides information about the
  currently logged-in user.
- New function ``cloud.health_check()`` checks the user's connection with the Coiled
  Cloud application.
- ``coiled login --server <url-for-your-coiled-deployment>`` now works if there is a
  trailing slash in the URL.
- ``coiled login --account <team_slug>`` sets the user's specified account as a config value.
- Previously, some ``coiled`` functions accepted ``account`` as an optional parameter,
  and others did not. Now the entire API consistently allows users to specify
  their account with an ``account=`` keyword argument. The priority order for
  choosing an account to make API requests is:

  #. Accounts specified via a resource name (where applicable), e.g. ``name = <account-name>/<software-environment-name>``
  #. Accounts specified via the ``account=`` keyword argument
  #. Accounts specified in your Coiled configuration file (i.e. ``~/.config/dask/coiled.yaml``)
  #. The default account associated with your username (as determined by the token you use to log in)

- Most of the resource creation functions in the ``coiled`` API (e.g.,
  ``coiled.Cluster()`` or ``coiled.create_software_environment()``) can take a lot of
  optional arguments. The order of these arguments in their function invocations
  is not important, and so they have been turned into keyword-only arguments.


0.0.39
======

Released on May 3, 2021.

- Following dask/distributed, we have dropped support for Python 3.6
- The arguments for ``coiled.Cluster()`` are now keyword-only.
- ``coiled`` is now more fully type annotated, allowing for better type checking
  and editor integration.
- ``coiled.Cloud.logs()`` now has ``account`` as an optional second parameter instead of
  a required first parameter to be more consistent with the rest of the API.
- Fixed a bug where updating the software environment in a cluster configuration
  did not work.
- Add a ``--private`` flag to the command line interface for ``coiled env create``.
- Fixed a bug where the ``rich`` console output from ``coiled`` did not work well with
  the Spyder editor.
- Fixed a bug where the ``coiled.Cloud.close()`` did not properly clean up threads.
