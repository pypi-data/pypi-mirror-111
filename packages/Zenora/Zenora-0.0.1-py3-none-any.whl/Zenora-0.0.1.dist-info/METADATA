A simple to use synchronous yet functional Discord REST API wrapper for Python

## What is Zenora

Zenora is a synchronous library for accessing the Discord REST API. It allows you to access the API without async/await. And also gives you REST-only API access, not the gateway. Pretty useful for making bot web dashboards, or desktop applications, etc. Oauth and other features will be added soon.

## Installation

Install from Git

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ahnaf-zamil/zenora
```

## Usage

```python
from zenora import APIClient

client = APIClient(token="...")
# There is also a set_token method which can be used to replace the token later on

# Make API request to get the currently logged in user object
user = client.users.get_current_user()

# Use the data :D
print(user.username)
```

## Documentation

Will be available as soon as possible.
