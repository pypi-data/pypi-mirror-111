- flatten
- get a histogram
- find modules with a condition
- check if linear layer
- seed everything
- freeze/unfreeze parts of a model
- count paramemeters and display tables
- count paramemeter state (frozen/unfrozen)
- easy pil<->tensor
- open image -> resize -> convert to tensor

## Models
- xresnet (all variants)

## Requirements
- PyTorchLightning. (This will install pretty much everything else)

## FAQ
- Why?
        - Well, lightning is an awesome library but there are some things I wanted globally so I decided to make an "Add Ons" package.
