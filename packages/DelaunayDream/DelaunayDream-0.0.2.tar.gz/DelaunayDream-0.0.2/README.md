# Delaunay-Dream
 
## Description
This Application allows the user to apply Delaunay triangulation to videos as a visual effect. It also allows for other visual effects such as changing the hue, saturation, and brightness of the video. All of these tools are presented in a simple and intuitive gui.
 
## Installation
*   To install from PyPI, run `pip install DelaunayDream`
*   To install from the sdist, run  `pip install (name_of_the_file).tar.gz`
	-   Or, unpack the tar.gz, navigate to root directory, and run `pip install .` 
 
## Commands
*   To run the program, type `delaunaydream` in your terminal.
	-	Recommended to use videos < 30 sec

## If the program throws a *Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb"* error
Try doing `sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5`, currently there seems to be some issue using PyQt with wsl and xServer on some machines
