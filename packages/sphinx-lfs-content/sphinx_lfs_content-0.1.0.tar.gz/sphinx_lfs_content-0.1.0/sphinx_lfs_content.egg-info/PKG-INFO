Description: # sphinx_lfs_content
        
        Git LFS is a popular method to store large files like e.g. documentation assets in git repositories.
        Building such documentation on a system without Git LFS will typically result in broken documentation. 
        `sphinx_lfs_content` is a minimalistic Sphinx extension that ensures that `git-lfs` is installed and otherwise installs it and fetches LFS content.
        It is motivated by the [lack of LFS support on readthedocs.org](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/1846).
        
        ## Installation
        
        The extension can be installed from PyPI using `pip`:
        
        ```python
        python -m pip install sphinx_lfs_content
        ```
        
        If you use a requirements file to describe the dependencies of your documentation build, simply add `sphinx_lfs_content` to it.
        
        ## How to use it
        
        Add the following lines to your `conf.py`:
        
        ```python
        # The list of enabled extensions
        extensions = [
            "sphinx_lfs_content",
        ]
        
        # The relative path from conf.py to the git repository root (defaults to ".")
        lfs_content_path_to_git_root = ".."
        ```
        
        That's all. The extension will check whether the system has `git-lfs` and download a version
        from the [`git-lfs` GitHub page](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs), verify its checksum
        and checkout any LFS content.
        
        The configuration value `lfs_content_path_to_git_root` needs to be given despite the
        fact that this information could be retrieved with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` in
        order to make the extension more robust against [recent build failures on ReadTheDocs](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/8288).
        
        ## Restrictions
        
        The extension is very likely to only work on Linux right now, as it does not properly select the `git-lfs` archive to download.
