What do you do?\n\nWell, with `what` all you have to do is ask `what "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99"` and `what` will tell you!\n\n`what`\'s job is to **identify _what_ something is.** Whether it be a file or text! Or even the hex of a file! What about text _within_ files? We have that too! `what` is recursive, it will identify **everything** in text and more!\n\n# ⚙ Use Cases\n\n## 🦠 Wannacry\n\n![](images_for_README/Screenshot%202021-05-09%20162158.png)\n\nYou come across a new piece of malware called WantToCry. You think back to Wannacry and remember it was stopped because a researcher found a kill-switch in the code.\n\nWhen a domain, hardcoded into Wannacry, was registered the virus would stop.\n\nYou use `What` to identify all the domains in the malware, and use a domain registrar API to register all the domains. If Wannacry happens again, you can stop it in minutes - not weeks.\n\n## 🦈 Faster Analysis of Pcap files\n\n![](images_for_README/pcap_demo.gif)\n\nSay you have a `.pcap` file from a network attack. `What` can identify this and quickly find you:\n\n- All hashes\n- Credit card numbers\n- Cryptocurrency addresses\n- Social Security Numbers\n- and much more.\n\nWith `what`, you can identify the important things in the pcap in seconds, not minutes.\n\n## 🌌 Anything\n\nAnytime you have a file and you want to find structured data in it that\'s useful, `What` is for you.\n\nOr if you come across some piece of text and you don\'t know what it is, `What` will tell you.\n\n**File Opening** You can pass in a file path by `what \'this/is/a/file/path\'`. `What` is smart enough to figure out it\'s a file!\n\nWhat about a whole **directory**? `What` can handle that too! It will **recursively** search for files and output everything you need!\n\n**Filtration** You can filter output by using `what --rarity 0.2:0.8 --include_tags tag1,tag2 TEXT`. Use `what --help` to get more information.\n\n**Sorting** You can sort the output by using `what -k rarity --reverse TEXT`. Use `what --help` to get more information.\n\n**Exporting** You can export to json using `what --json` and results can be sent directly to a file using `what --json > file.json`.\n\n# 🍕 API\n\nPyWhat has an API! Click here [https://github.com/bee-san/pyWhat/wiki/API](https://github.com/bee-san/pyWhat/wiki/API) to read about it.\n\n# 👾 Contributing\n\n`what` not only thrives on contributors, but can\'t exist without them! If you want to add a new regex to check for things, you can read our documentation [here](https://github.com/bee-san/what/wiki/Adding-your-own-Regex)\n\nWe ask contributors to join the Discord for quicker discussions, but it\'s not needed:\n<img alt="Discord" src="https://img.shields.io/discord/754001738184392704">\n',
