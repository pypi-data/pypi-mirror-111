### Added

- A new command line tool has been added: **emscli**. It's a command line tool to interact with WEGA-EMS. This first release icludes 2 subcommands used to backup/restore a Project:

  - _export_: Export the selected project in specific directory
  - _import_: Import an exported project

  Please check the documentation for more informations.

- Method _variants_tree()_ has been added to the EmsProject Class. The output of this method is an iterable with the current variant tree structure:

```

### Changed

- The attachments method has a new parameter _asUrl_. If True, the output will contain the exact
  path of an attachment. This is important to get the exact path of an attachment when using hash-storage as storaging system.

- The same query parameter of WEGA-EMS query, can be used inside the query method. This is usefull, for example _returnIdsOnly_ to return only the ids of the features.

```python
query = my_layer.query(where="ID<40", returnIdsOnly=True)
```

- The query method accept a geometry to limit the results to a specific extent. For example:

```python
FILTER_GEOMETRY = {
        "xmin": 400041.3182861694,
        "ymin": 5579618.707941717,
        "xmax": 401007.4908240417,
        "ymax": 5580061.03023693
    }

query = my_layer.query(geometry=FILTER_GEOMETRY)
```
