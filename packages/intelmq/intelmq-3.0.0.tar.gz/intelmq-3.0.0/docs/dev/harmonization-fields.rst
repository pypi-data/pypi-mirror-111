Classification              classification.identifier           :ref:`string`                 The lowercase identifier defines the actual software or service (e.g. ``heartbleed`` or ``ntp_version``) or standardized malware name (e.g. ``zeus``). Note that you MAY overwrite this field during processing for your individual setup. This field is not standardized across IntelMQ setups/users.
Classification              classification.taxonomy             :ref:`classificationtaxonomy` We recognize the need for the CSIRT teams to apply a static (incident) taxonomy to abuse data. With this goal in mind the type IOC will serve as a basis for this activity. Each value of the dynamic type mapping translates to a an element in the static taxonomy. The European CSIRT teams for example have decided to apply the eCSIRT.net incident classification. The value of the taxonomy key is thus a derivative of the dynamic type above. For more information about check `ENISA taxonomies <http://www.enisa.europa.eu/activities/cert/support/incident-management/browsable/incident-handling-process/incident-taxonomy/existing-taxonomies>`_.
Classification              classification.type                 :ref:`classificationtype`     The abuse type IOC is one of the most crucial pieces of information for any given abuse event. The main idea of dynamic typing is to keep our ontology flexible, since we need to evolve with the evolving threatscape of abuse data. In contrast with the static taxonomy below, the dynamic typing is used to perform business decisions in the abuse handling pipeline. Furthermore, the value data set should be kept as minimal as possible to avoid *type explosion*, which in turn dilutes the business value of the dynamic typing. In general, we normally have two types of abuse type IOC: ones referring to a compromised resource or ones referring to pieces of the criminal infrastructure, such as a command and control servers for example.

At present, the hash should default to using the SHA1 function. Please note that for an event hash to be able to match more than one event (deduplication) the receiver of an event should calculate it based on a minimal set of keys and values present in the event. Using for example the observation time in the calculation will most likely render the checksum useless for deduplication purposes.

Harmonization types
-------------------

.. _asn:

ASN
---

ASN type. Derived from Integer with forbidden values.

Only valid are: 0 < asn <= 4294967295
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)
> The first and last ASNs of the original 16-bit integers, namely 0 and
> 65,535, and the last ASN of the 32-bit numbers, namely 4,294,967,295 are
> reserved and should not be used by operators.


.. _accuracy:

Accuracy
--------

Accuracy type. A Float between 0 and 100.


.. _base64:

Base64
------

Base64 type. Always gives unicode strings.

Sanitation encodes to base64 and accepts binary and unicode strings.


.. _boolean:

Boolean
-------

Boolean type. Without sanitation only python bool is accepted.

Sanitation accepts string 'true' and 'false' and integers 0 and 1.


.. _classificationtaxonomy:

ClassificationTaxonomy
----------------------

`classification.taxonomy` type.

The mapping follows
Reference Security Incident Taxonomy Working Group – RSIT WG
https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force/

These old values are automatically mapped to the new ones:
    'abusive content' -> 'abusive-content'
    'information gathering' -> 'information-gathering'
    'intrusion attempts' -> 'intrusion-attempts'
    'malicious code' -> 'malicious-code'

Allowed values are:
 * abusive-content
 * availability
 * fraud
 * information-content-security
 * information-gathering
 * intrusion-attempts
 * intrusions
 * malicious-code

------------------

`classification.type` type.

The mapping follows
Reference Security Incident Taxonomy Working Group – RSIT WG
https://github.com/enisaeu/Reference-Security-Incident-Taxonomy-Task-Force/

--------

Date and time type for timestamps.

Valid values are timestamps with time zone and in the format '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S+00:00'.
Invalid are missing times and missing timezone information (UTC).
Microseconds are also allowed.

Sanitation normalizes the timezone to UTC, which is the only allowed timezone.

The following additional conversions are available with the convert function:

    * timestamp
    * windows_nt: From Windows NT / AD / LDAP
    * epoch_millis: From Milliseconds since Epoch
    * from_format: From a given format, eg. 'from_format|%H %M %S %m %d %Y %Z'
    * from_format_midnight: Date from a given format and assume midnight, e.g. 'from_format_midnight|%d-%m-%Y'
    * utc_isoformat: Parse date generated by datetime.isoformat()
    * fuzzy (or None): Use dateutils' fuzzy parser, default if no specific parser is given
