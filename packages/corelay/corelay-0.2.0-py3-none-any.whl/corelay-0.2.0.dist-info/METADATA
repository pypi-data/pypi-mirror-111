# Compose Relevance Analysis (CoRelAy)

CoRelAy is a tool to compose small-scale (single-machine) analysis pipelines.
Pipelines are designed with a number of steps (Task) with default operations (Processor).
Any step of the pipeline may then be indiviually changed by assigning a new operator (Processor).
Processors have Params which define their operation.
A quick practical explanation of Pipelines, Tasks, Processors and Params is shown in `example/corelay_basics.py`.

CoRelAy was created to to quickly implement pipelines to generate analysis data
which can then be visualized using ViRelAy.

If you find CoRelAy useful for your research, why not cite our related [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13200):

## Install

CoRelAy may be installed using pip with
```shell
$ pip install corelay
```

To install optional HDBSCAN and UMAP support, use
```shell
$ pip install corelay[umap,hdbscan]
```

## Usage
Examples to highlight some features of **CoRelAy** can be found in `example/`.

We mainly use HDF5 files to store results. The structure used by **ViRelAy** is documented in the **ViRelAy**
repository at `docs/database_specification.md`. An example to create HDF5 files which can be used with **ViRelAy** is
shown in `example/hdf5_structure.py`

To do a full SpRAy analysis which can be visualized with **ViRelAy**, an advanced script can be found in
`example/virelay_analysis.py`.
