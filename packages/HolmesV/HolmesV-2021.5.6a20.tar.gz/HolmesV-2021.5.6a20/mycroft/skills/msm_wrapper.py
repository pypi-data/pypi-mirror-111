"""Common logic for instantiating the Mycroft Skills Manager.

The Mycroft Skills Manager (MSM) does a lot of interactions with git.  The
more skills that are installed on a device, the longer these interactions
take.  This is especially true at boot time when MSM is instantiated
frequently.  To improve performance, the MSM instance is cached.
