Similar exceptions are allowable as in rule 2.\n  - `pylint --disable=C0111,W1203,R0903 --max-line-length=100 ...`\n  - `flake8 --max-line-length=100 ...`\n  - `mypy --ignore-missing-imports --follow-imports=skip --strict-optional ...`\n- All incoming information from users, clients, and configurations should be validated.\n- All internal arguments passing should be typechecked whenever possible with `typeguard.typechecked`\n\n### Development Setup\n\nUsing [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) install from inside the repo directory:\n\n```bash\npoetry install\n```\n\nThis will set up a virtualenv which you can always activate with either `poetry shell` or run specific commands with `poetry run`. All instructions below that are meant to be run in the virtualenv will be prefaced with `(legion-utils)$ `\n\n#### IDE Setup\n\n**Sublime Text 3**\n\n```bash\ncurl -sSL https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2066312/raw/master/poetry.sublime-project.py | poetry run python\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nAll testing should be done with `pytest` which is installed with the `dev` requirements.\n\nTo run all the unit tests, execute the following from the repo directory:\n\n```bash\n(legion-utils)$ pytest\n```\n\nThis should produce a coverage report in `/path/to/dewey-api/htmlcov/`\n\nWhile developing, you can use [`watchexec`](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) to monitor the file system for changes and re-run the tests:\n\n```bash\n(legion-utils)$ watchexec -r -e py,yaml pytest\n```\n\nTo run a specific test file:\n\n```bash\npytest tests/unit/test_core.py\n```\n\nTo run a specific test:\n\n```bash\npytest tests/unit/test_core.py::test_hello\n```\n\nFor more information on testing, see the `pytest.ini` file as well as the [documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/).\n',
