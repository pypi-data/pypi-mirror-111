It's called mypythontools, but it's also made for you...

Usually used from IDE. Used paths are infered and things like sphinx rst docs generation, building
application with pyinstaller or deploying to Pypi is matter of calling one function,
or clicking one button (e.g. Vs code task).

Many projects - one codebase.

If you are not sure whether structure of your app will work with this code, check `project-starter` on github in content folder.

Paths are infered, but if you have atypical structure or have more projects in cwd, use `mypythontools.paths.set_paths()`.

## Modules

- build
- deploy
- misc
- paths
- pyvueeel (for applications build with eel and vue)
- utils (various functions callable from one `push_pipeline` function)

Check modules help with examples.

## Installation

Python >=3.6 (Python 2 is not supported).

Install just with

```console
pip install mypythontools
```

## Content

There are some other things that are not installed via pip in mypythontools library.

### project-starter

Project scaffolding fast and easy.

Download project-starter from (github)[https://github.com/Malachov/mypythontools/tree/master/content/project-starter] (You may need to download all mypythontools repository in zip)

And start developing.

In your IDE do bulk renaming across files and replace `SET_YOUR_APP_NAME` with name of your app / library.

This starter is for vue-eel applications (desktop as well as web) but also for python libraries that will be stored on Pypi.

**Used as a python library**

If it's python library, delete `gui` folder.

**Used as an application**
It can be opened as web page from explorer, or it can be opened as standalone desktop application (looks similar to electron and require chrome or chromium on the background).

If it's app with gui, delete `setup.py`, `__init__.py` and remove **Installation** and **Modules** from README. Also from
assets delete `mdi.css` if not using icons and `formulate.css` if not using **vue formulate**. In
`package.json` uncomment library you will be using.

Install used python libraries via `pip install -r requirements.txt` and install JS libraries as well with
`npm install` in folder where package.json is.

To run an app in develop mode, you have to run both frontent as well as python. Run frontent with debugging app.py (do not run, just debug). Then run frontend with `npm run serve` in gui folder (or use Task explorer if using VS Code). Open your favourite browser and open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

It's recommended to use Vue.js devtools extension where you can see what component is on cursor, edit props values or see list of all used mutations.

In opened app, there is a little help button where there is simple overview about how to develop with these tools.

Delete is faster than write, so there is many working examples like for example plot, various formating (flex row, flex column), settings panel, function call from python to js and vice versa or automatic alerting from python. If you want to see how some example is working, just use **ctrl + F** in IDE or check components for it's props.

This is how the example looks like

<div align="center"><img src="docs/source/_static/project-starter-gui.png" width="620" alt="project-starter-gui"/></div>

For a desktop version where user does not have python installed, you have to build it first. Use mypython _build_ module (trigger with tasks button).

**Docs**
It includes docs structure for sphinx docs generations from docstrings. Edit first few lines in conf.py, index.rst, navi.html and if you want, add static files like logo to \_static.

Usually used with [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/) free hosting that trigger deploy automatically after pushing to master. Because of correct relative redirecting in index.rst and navi.html use for readthedocs /path/ before relative link to ohter module.

It's also necassary to generate other modules rst files for other pages but it's if using `push_script.py` as CI/CD (see below), it's generated automatically via `apidoc`.

It's recommended to use with `sphinx-alabaster-css` (see below).

**CI/CD**
Project include `.travis.yml` for Travis CI, but it's not recommended to use it. There is file `push_script.py` in folder `utils` which for my use case is better (faster) than travis and can do most of what you want from CI like run pipeline - running tests / generate docs / increment version / push to github / push to pypi.

You can delete `.travis.yml`. If you want to generate test coverage badge (usually from travis), you can use github actions yml file for pushing codecov coverage file (without token).

Check utils module for more informations.

**IDE files**
It also include some default project specific settings for VS Code. You can also delete it.

If developing py - vue - eel app this is the recommended way, but if you want to build just what is necassary from scratch, you can use this tutorial [readthedocs](https://mypythontools.readthedocs.io/mypythontools.pyvueeel.html#mypythontools.pyvueeel.help_starter_pack_vue_app).

### requirements

Install many libraries at once (no need for Anaconda). Download `requirements.txt` file from (github)[https://github.com/Malachov/mypythontools/tree/master/content/requirements] and in that folder use

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It's good for python libraries that other users with different versions of libraries will use. If not standalone application where freezing into virtual env is good idea - here is possible to use this requirements with using --upgrade from time to time to be sure that your library will be working for up to date version of dependencies.

### sphinx-alabaster-css

It's good idea to generate documentation from code. If you are useing sphinx and alabaster theme, you can use this css file for formating.

Tested on readthedocs hosting (recommended).

CSS are served from github and it's possible to change on one place and edit how all projects docs look like at once.

Just add this to sphinx conf.py

```
html_css_files = [
    "https://malachov.github.io/readthedocs-sphinx-alabaster-css/custom.css",
]
```

Also of course if you want you can download it and use locally from project if you need.

Result should look like this

<div align="center"><img src="docs/source/_static/sphinx-alabaster-css.png" width="620" alt="sphinx-alabaster-css"/></div>

### Tasks

There are VS Code tasks examples in utils and build module, but here is small tutorial how to use it.
Run command `Tasks: Open User Tasks`, add tasks from github/content/tasks or if have no task yet, you can copy / paste all.

Install extension **Task Explorer**

On root copy folder `utils` from content/tasks

You are ready to go. You should see something like this

<div align="center"><img src="docs/source/_static/tasks.png" width="620" alt="tasks"/></div>

You can do CI / CD pipeline or Build app with one click now.
