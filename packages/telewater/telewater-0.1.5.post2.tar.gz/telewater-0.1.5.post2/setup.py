    'long_description': "# telewater\n\nA telegram bot that applies watermark on images, gifs and videos.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Fast** because it is made using async libraries.\n- **Simple** to use.\n- Any one who uses an instance of the bot will have to use the same watermark and position. This is meant to be used by **single person/organization** (by only you or your team), as configuration is stored at a global level instead of per user basis.\n- **No database** connection required.\n- It **does not store media** (photos/videos/gifs) on the server. Media is deleted immediately after the watermarked version is sent to the user.\n\nWatch this [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-ouyCPdZw0) to learn how to use and deploy this bot.\n\n## Usage\n\nUsing the bot is very simple. Just send a photo, video or gif to the bot. The bot will reply with the watermarked media.\n\nThe bot commands `/set` and `/get` can set and get the value of the configuration variables. The commands are simple and intuitive. The bot will show you the usage if you send an incorrect argument.\n\n## Deploy\n\nClick on [this link](https://m.do.co/c/98b725055148) and get **free 100$**\non Digital Ocean.\n\n[![DigitalOcean Referral Badge](https://web-platforms.sfo2.digitaloceanspaces.com/WWW/Badge%203.svg)](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=98b725055148&utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&utm_medium=Referral_Program&utm_source=badge)\n\n> **NOTE** You will get nothing if you directly sign up from Digital Ocean Home Page.\n> **Use the link** above, or **click on the big fat button** above to get free 100$.\n\nRead the **[Guide to Deploy to Digital Ocean](https://github.com/aahnik/telewater/wiki/Deploy-to-Digital-Ocean)**.\n\n------\n\nThis application can also be easily deployed to Heroku, which is extremely good if you want to enjoy a free tier.\n\nYou may [read further](#further-reading) to learn about more more deployment options.\n\n[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/aahnik/telewater)\n\nClick on the above button. A form will appear, where you need to enter the credentials for the bot.

Just go ahead with the heroku method described abvoe.\n\nIf you are familiar with **Docker** then [click here](https://github.com/aahnik/telewater/wiki/Install-and-run-using-docker) otherwise, continue reading.\n\n#### Requirements\n\nMake sure to have these installed in your system.\n\n- [python3.9+](https://www.python.org/) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) (the bot is built with the telethon library)\n- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (used by the bot for applying watermark)\n\n#### Verification\n\nOpen you terminal to check if you have all basic requirements properly installed.\n\n1. Run `python --version` and you should get something like this `Python 3.9.2` (or above).\n2. Run `pip --version` and you should get `pip 20.2.2` (or above).\n\n    > Some systems may require to use `python3` and `pip3` instead of the above.\n\n3. Run `ffmpeg -h` and it should display a help message and version above `4.2.4`.\n\n#### Install via pip\n\n```shell\npip install telewater\n```\n\n#### Starting `telewater`\n\nTelewater has a simple command line interface to start the bot.\n\nSimply open your terminal and run `telewater`.
