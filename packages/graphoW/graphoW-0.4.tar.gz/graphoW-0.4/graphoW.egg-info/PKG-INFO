Description: # graphoW: A python package for building Graph of Words 
        
        graphoW is a Python package for the creation of a Graph-of-Words (GoW) representation of texts.
        
        - Structure is based on: ["Graph-of-word and TW-IDF: new approach to ad hoc IR"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2505515.2505671)
        - Graph metrics are based on: ["Graph analysis of dream reports is especially informative about psychosis"](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep03691?hc_location=ufi)
        - Narrative consistency and rapidity are based on: ["Measuring Narrative Fluency by Analyzing Dynamic Interaction Networks in Textual Narratives"](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2593/paper2.pdf)
        
        It allows to:
        
        - Create a GoW for individual texts.
        - Create a container of GoW in which each GoW corresponds to a paragraph in the text. 
        - Compute diverse types of graph metrics (e.g., individual, global, connectivity...).
        - Compute the narrative consistency of text based on all terms or only on noun phrases.
        - Compute the rapidity of a text, i.e., how slow/fast change the structure of paragraphs.
        
        GoW is supported using [``NetworkX``](https://networkx.org/).
