## Introduction

This purpose was written to facilitate generation of "similar" datasets based
on a single dataset. The original intention was to "dirty" a dataset before
providing it to students for classroom assignments.

There are three classes defined here: DirtyDF, Stainer, and History. 

Stainers Dirty a DataFrame.

Custom stainers can be written to create new stains.
