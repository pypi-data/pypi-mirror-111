## Qualys API Best Practices Series
The example code from the [Qualys API Best Practices Series](https://blog.qualys.com/tag/api-best-practices-series) 
is being hosted here to help customers with an example blueprint to automate transformation 
of data into their corporate data systems, further enhancing the visibility of outlier systems 
that are vulnerable.  

This example code has been enhanced with some exception processing, logging, and a single point of execution
creating an operational context within which to test/develop the code so customers can build automation 
into their remediation program. 

### Workflow Diagram
The workflow depicts the flow of etl for host list detection.  The key output is the sqlite database that is ready for distribution
- qetl_manage_user -u [userdir] -e etl_host_list_detection -d [datetime] - Resulting sqlite database ready for distribution.

### Blueprint
Customer have many options for Qualys API integration today.  Some customers realize they need to develop their own 
internal code to transform complex data, create custom metrics, create custom reports or ensure data is more accessible within their organizations for metrics and custom reporting.

As a result, Qualys decided on creating the API Best Practices Series to jumpstart clients with a blueprint of example code
to help them automate delivery of complex data into their enterprise.  

The overarching goal is to simplify our customers security stack and help them significantly reduce cost and 
complexity.

Key Goals and Solutions of this series are:

Goal | Solution
------------ | -------------
Automate Vulnerability Data accessibility, transformation of complex data for analysis | JSON, CSV, SQLite Database Formats of Qualys Data readily accessible to Analytical BI Tools for on-demand analysis or for downstream loading into Enterprise Data Storage.
A single query interface to Qualys data | TBD Future GraphQL Server interface to data.
Automate Capturing Vulnerability Data into corporate processes | Blueprint of example code customers can customize to enhance their internal automation "API-First" strategy.
Automate Distribution of Vulnerability Data to Cloud Providers | Optional Distribution methods into cloud systems such as Amazon S3 Bucket
Automate Application Enhancements and Delivery | Docker application instance for reliable CI/CD delivery of enhancements, as well as traditional host execution on Linux Platforms.
Provide Execution Flexibility, Work Load Management, Password Security | Blueprint for enterprise jobstream execution (Ex. Autosys), password vaults (Ex. Hashicorp), or simple command line execution from a Virtual Machine instance of Ubuntu running on a laptop.
Provide Continous Vulnerability Data Pipeline | Blueprint for data transformation pipeline from Qualys to Enterprise Data Stores in various formats ( JSON, CSV, SQLite Database )

### ETL KnowledgeBase
KnowledgeBase ETL - Incremental Update to Knowledgebase.  CSV, JSON, SQLite are full knowledgebase.  XML is incremental.
   - note the knowledgebase will rebuild itself every 30-90 days to ensure gdbm is reorganized.
```bash
qetl_manage_user -u /opt/qetl/users/quser -e etl_knowledgebase 
```

### ETL Host List
Host List ETL - Download Host List based on date
  - if no date is used, Host List will auto increment from last run 
    ( max LAST_VULN_SCAN_DATETIME ) or if no sqlite database exists
    it download start incremental pull from utc minus 1 day. 
```bash
qetl_manage_user -u /opt/qetl/users/quser -e etl_host_list -d [YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ]
```
   
See [Application Manager and Data](#application-manager-and-data) for location of your qetl_home directory.
   
### ETL Host List Detection
Host List Detection ETL - Includes KnowledgeBase and Host List so do not run ETL Host List or ETL KnowledgeBase while Host List Detection ETL is runnning..
  - if no date is used, The Host List Driver will auto increment from last run
      ( max LAST_VULN_SCAN_DATETIME ) or if no sqlite database exists
      it download start incremental pull from utc minus 1 day. 
```bash
qetl_manage_user -u /opt/qetl/users/quser -e etl_host_list_detection -d [YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ]
```

### Host List Tag Requirements
   To operate the host list API, optionally you can create 4 tags to isolate different types of data to be 
   downloaded via API.  There is an example script to help create the tags in your subscription.  
   See etld_templates/etld_create_host_list_extract_cloud_server_tags.py for example of creating tags through API.

### Optional First Time Setup Host List Tags
   
    Optional custom tags are qetl-all-hosts, qetl-all-ec2, qetl-all-gcp, qetl-all-azure.

     1) qetl-all-ec2: Type:Dynamic->Rule-Type:Cloud Asset Search->Provider:EC2->Rule Query:aws.ec2.accountId:*
     2) qetl-all-azure: Type:Dynamic->Rule-Type:Cloud Asset Search->Provider:Azure->Rule Query:azure.vm.subscriptionId:*
     3) qetl-all-gcp: Type:Dynamic->Rule-Type:Cloud Asset Search->Provider:GCP->Rule Query:gcp.compute.instanceId:*
     4) qetl-all-hosts: Type:Dynamic->Rule-Type:Groovy Scriptlet->Rule Query:return true;

     "qetl-all-ec2": {"ruleText": "aws.ec2.accountId:*", "ruleType": "CLOUD_ASSET",  "provider": "EC2"},
     "qetl-all-gcp": {"ruleText": "gcp.compute.instanceId:*", "ruleType": "CLOUD_ASSET",  "provider": "GCP"},
     "qetl-all-azure": {"ruleText": "azure.vm.subscriptionId:*", "ruleType": "CLOUD_ASSET",  "provider": "AZURE"},
     "qetl-all-hosts": {"ruleText": "return true;", "ruleType": "GROOVY",  "provider": "NONE"}

### Logging

### Application Monitoring
- To monitor the application for issues, the logging format includes a logging level.  
- Monitoring for ERROR will help identify issues and tend to the overall health of the applicaiton operation.

## Securing Your Application in the Data Center
Follow your corporate procedures for securing your application.  A key recommendation is to use a password vault
or remote invocation method that passes the credentials at run time so the password isn't stored on the system.

### Password Vault
Qualys recommends customers move to a password vault of their chosing to operate this applications credentials.
By creating functions to obtain credentials from your corporations password vault, you can improve 
the security of your application by separating the password from the machine.  

One way customers can do this is through a work load management solution, where the external work load management
system ( Ex. Autosys ) schedules jobs passing the required keys to this application at runtime.  This eliminates
the need to store credentials locally on your system.

If you are unfamiliar with password vaults, here is one example from Hashicorp.
- [Hashicorp Products Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault)
- [Hashicorp Getting Started](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/getting-started-intro?in=vault/getting-started)

### qetl_setup_python_env

```bash
qualysetl@ubuntu:~/.local/bin$ ./qetl_setup_python_venv /opt/qetl
Start qetl_setup_python_venv - Thu 17 Jun 2021 08:39:41 PM PDT
  1) test_os_for_required_commands
  2) test_for_pip_connectivity
  3) prepare_opt_qetl_env_dirs

    usage:        qetl_setup_python_venv [/path/to/dir]

    description:

        Create a python3 virtual environment, and install the qualysetl application into that environment for usage.
        This isolates the qualysetl application dependencies to the python3 virtual environment.

            If you plan to setup your python virtual environment outside of your default home directory,
            please ensure you have authorization to create directories in the target location.

    examples:
            1) qetl_setup_python_venv /opt/qetl
               - will work if you pre-create /opt/qetl as you have to be root to write to /opt
            2) qetl_setup_python_venv /usr/local
               - will result in /usr/local/opt/qetl if you have authorization to write to /usr/local
            3) qetl_setup_python_venv
               - Default will be your /home/qualysetl/opt/qetl directory.


Create qetl Python Environment? /opt/qetl/qetl_venv
Do you want to create your python3 virtual environment for qetl? ( yes or no ) yes

ok, creating python3 virtual /opt/qetl/qetl_venv


  4) create_qetl_python_venv - will run for about 1-2 minutes

   Success! Your python virtual environment for qetl is: /opt/qetl/qetl_venv

   Your python3 venv separates your base python installation from the qetl python requirements
   and is your entry to executing the qetl_manage_user application.  Your base qetl installation has
   moved to your python virtual environment: /opt/qetl/qetl_venv

   !!! save these commands as they are your entry to run the qetl application
   
       1) source /opt/qetl/qetl_venv/bin/activate
       2) /opt/qetl/qetl_venv/bin/qetl_manage_user ( Your entry point to operating qualysetl ) 

   Next steps:

    Enter your python3 virtual environment and begin testing qualys connectivity.

       1) source /opt/qetl/qetl_venv/bin/activate
       2) /opt/qetl/qetl_venv/bin/qetl_manage_user
