        ---
        
        ## How to use
        
        If you want to see some examples go [here](https://github.com/VL07/discord.py-game-engine/tree/main/examples) or follow almong this tutorial to get a basic understanding of how this module works.
        
        Start by importing the module
        
        ```python
        import discord_game
        from discord_game import screen
        ```
        
        You will also need the discord libary to create the client
        
        ```python
        import discord
        ```
        
        Then you can start by creating the discord client
        
        ```python
        client = discord.Client()
        ```
        
        Now you can create the game and set its startcommand. Our is `!start`
        
        ```python
        game = discord_game.Game(client, "!start")
        ```
        
        Use the `onStart` event to run code when someone starts the game. The `onBotReady` runs when the bot/client is ready. 
        
        ```python
        @game.event.onStart
        async def onStart(display):
            print("The game is started")
        
        @game.event.onBotReady
        async def ready():
            print("bot is ready")
        ```
        
        Don't forget to add `client.run(token)` at the end of the file
        
        ```python
        client.run("Your token")
        ```
        
        You can create a sprite like this
        
        ```python
        mySprite = screen.Sprite(display, ["costume", "with", "multiple rows"], 0, 0) # and lastly x and y pos
        ```
        
        Then you will need to update the display
        
        ```python
        await display.update()
        ```
        
        To create a button you do it like this
        
        ```python
        myButton = await s.addButton("Click me!")
        ```
        
        To get a button click put this code inside the onstart function
        
        ```python
        @myButton.onClick
        async def clicked(btn):
            print("You clicked me!")
        ```
        
        The complete code
        
        ```python
        import discord_game
        from discord_game import screen
        import discord
        
        client = discord.Client()
        
        game = discord_game.Game(client, "!start")
        
        @game.event.onStart
        async def onStart(display):
            print("The game is started")
        
        @game.event.onBotReady
        async def ready():
            print("bot is ready")
        
            mySprite = screen.Sprite(display, ["costume", "with", "multiple rows"], 0, 0) # and lastly x and y pos
        
            await display.update()
        
            myButton = await s.addButton("Click me!")
        
            @myButton.onClick
            async def clicked(btn):
                print("You clicked me!")
            
        client.run("Your token")
        ```
