Usage
=====

Creating plugins
----------------
If you use git in your project, install the ``gitpython`` module (``pip install gitpython``). ``startplugin`` will determine your git user/email automatically and use it.

Create a plugin using a Django management command:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./manage.py startplugin fooplugin

This command asks a few questions, creates a basic Django app in the plugin path chosen in ``PluginManager.find_plugins()``. It provides useful defaults as well as a setup.py/setup.cfg file.

You now have two choices for this plugin:

* add it statically to ``INSTALLED_APPS``: see `Static plugins <#static-plugins>`_.
* make use of the dynamic loading feature: see `Dynamic plugins <#dynamic-plugins>`_.

Static plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In most of the cases, you will ship your application with a few
"standard" plugins that are statically installed. These plugins must be
loaded *after* the ``gdaps`` app.

.. code-block:: python

    # ...

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ... standard Django apps and GDAPS
        "gdaps",

        # put "static" plugins here too:
        "myproject.plugins.fooplugin",
    ]

This plugin app is loaded as usual, but your GDAPS enhanced Django application
can make use of it's GDAPS features.

Dynamic plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By installing a plugin with pip, you can make your application
aware of that plugin too:

.. code:: bash

    pip install -e myproject/plugins/fooplugin

This installs the plugin as python module into the site-packages and
makes it discoverable using setuptools. From this moment on it should be
already registered and loaded after a Django server restart. Of course
this also works when plugins are installed from PyPi, they don't have to
be in the project's ``plugins`` folder. You can conveniently start
developing plugins in there, and later move them to the PyPi repository.


The plugin AppConfig
--------------------

Plugins' AppConfigs must provide an inner class named ``PluginMeta``, or a so named attribute pointing to an external class. For more information see :class:`gdaps.apps.PluginMeta`.

.. _Interfaces:

Interfaces
----------

Plugins can define interfaces, which can then be implemented by other
plugins. The cookiecutter template contains a ``<app_name>/api/interfaces.py`` file automatically.
It's not obligatory to put all Interface definitions in ``api.interfaces``, but it is a recommended coding style for GDAPS plugins:

.. code-block:: python

    from gdaps import Interface

    @Interface
    class IFooInterface:
        """Documentation of the interface"""

        __service__ = True  # is the default
        some_attr = "default"

        def do_something(self):
            pass

Interfaces can have some attributes that define Interface options. Available options are:

.. _service:

__service__
    If ``__service__ = True`` is set (which is the default), then all implementations are
    instantiated directly at loading time, having a full class instance
    availably at any time. Iterations over Interfaces return **instances**:

    .. code-block:: python

        for plugin in IFooInterface:
            plugin.do_something()

..

    If you use ``__service__ = False``, the plugins are not instantiated, and
    iterations over Instances will return **classes**, not instances.
    This may be desired for reducing memory footprint, data classes, or classes that
    just contain static or class methods.

    .. code-block:: python

        for plugin in INonServiceInterface:
            print(plugin.name)  # class attribute
            plugin.classmethod()

            # if you need instances, you have to instantiate the plugin here.
            # this is not recommended.
            p = plugin()
            p.do_something()

.. _Implementations:

Implementations
---------------

You can then easily implement this interface in any other file (in this
plugin or in another plugin) by subclassing the interface:

.. code-block:: python

    from myproject.plugins.fooplugin.api.interfaces import IFooInterface

    class OtherPluginClass(IFooInterface):

        def do_something(self):
            print('I did something!')


Using Implementations
---------------------
You can straight-forwardly use implementations that are bound to an interface by iterating over that interface,
anywhere in your code.

.. code-block:: python

    from myproject.plugins.fooplugin.api.interfaces import IFooInterface

    class MyPlugin:

        def foo_method(self):
            for plugin in IFooInterface:
                print plugin.do_domething()

Depending on the `__service__ <#service>`__ Meta flag, iterating over an Interface
returns either a **class** (``__service__ = False``) or an **instance** (``__service__ = True``), which is the default.


Extending Django's URL patterns
-------------------------------

To let your plugin define some URLs that are automatically detected by your Django application, you
have to add a code fragment to your global urls.py file:

.. code-block:: python

    from gdaps.pluginmanager import PluginManager
    urlpatterns = PluginManager.urlpatterns() + [
        # add your fixed, non-plugin paths here.
    ]


GDAPS then loads and imports all available plugins' *urls.py*  files,
collects their ``urlpatterns`` variables and includes them into merges them into the global urlpattern, using the ``app_name`` namespace defined in the plugin's urls.py:

.. code-block:: python

    from .views import MyUrlView, SomeViewSet
    from django.views.generic import TemplateView
    # fooplugin/urls.py

    app_name = "fooplugin"

    # This will be merged into the "fooplugin/" namespace
    urlpatterns = [
        path("", TemplateView("foo/index.html").as_view(), name="index"),
        path("detail/", MyUrlView.as_view(), name="detail"),

        # ...
    ]


GDAPS also lets your plugin create global, root URLs (not namespaced) by using ``root_urlpatterns``. This is because some plugins need to create global (e.g. API) URLS for frameworks like DRF, etc.

.. code-block:: python

    # This will be merged into the global urlpattern
    root_urlpatterns = [
        path("api/foo/", SomeViewSet.as_view(), name="api")
    ]

Beware:
    Plugins are responsible for their URLs and namespaces, and that they don't collide with others.


.. _Routers:

DRF API Routers
---------------

DRF offers great router classes, but implementations always assume that your main urls.py knows about all of your apps. GDAPS lets you define one `SimpleRouter` for each of your apps, and automatically collects them into one global `DefaultRouter`. 

In your global `urls.py` add:

.. code-block:: python

    router = PluginManager.router()
    urlpatterns = [
        # ...
        path("api/", include(router.urls)),
    ]

In your apps' urls.py, similar to urlpatterns, create a `router` variable:

.. code-block:: python

    from rest_framework.routers import SimpleRouter

    router = SimpleRouter()
    router.register(r"app", AppListViewSet)

...where AppListViewSet is your DRF ViewSet. That's all, GDAPS takes care of the merging.

.. _Settings:

Per-plugin Settings
-------------------

GDAPS allows your application to have own settings for each plugin
easily, which provide defaults, and can be overridden in the global
``settings.py`` file. Look at the example conf.py file (created by
``./manage.py startplugin fooplugin``), and adapt to your needs:

.. code-block:: python

    from django.test.signals import setting_changed
    from gdaps.conf import PluginSettings

    NAMESPACE = "FOOPLUGIN"

    # Optional defaults. Leave empty if not needed.
    DEFAULTS = {
        "MY_SETTING": "somevalue",
        "FOO_PATH": "django.blah.foo",
        "BAR": [
            "baz",
            "buh",
        ],
    }

    # Optional list of settings that are allowed to be in "string import" notation. Leave empty if not needed.
    IMPORT_STRINGS = (
        "FOO_PATH"
    )

    # Optional list of settings that have been removed. Leave empty if not needed.
    REMOVED_SETTINGS = ( "FOO_SETTING" )


    fooplugin_settings = PluginSettings("FOOPLUGIN", None, DEFAULTS, IMPORT_STRINGS)

Detailed explanation:

DEFAULTS
   The ``DEFAULTS`` are, as the name says, a default array of settings. If
   ``fooplugin_setting.BLAH`` is not set by the user in settings.py, this
   default value is used.

IMPORT_STRINGS
   Settings in a *dotted* notation are evaluated, they return not the
   string, but the object they point to. If it does not exist, an
   ``ImportError`` is raised.

REMOVED_SETTINGS
   A list of settings that are forbidden to use. If accessed, an
   ``RuntimeError`` is raised.

   This allows very flexible settings - as dependant plugins can easily
   import the ``fooplugin_settings`` from your ``conf.py``.

   However, the created conf.py file is not needed, so if you don't use
   custom settings at all, just delete the file.


Admin site
----------
GDAPS provides support for the Django admin site. The built-in ``GdapsPlugin`` model automatically
are added to Django's admin site, and can be administered there.

.. note::

    As GdapsPlugin database entries must not be edited directly, they are shown read-only in the admin.
    **Please use the 'syncplugins' management command to
    update the fields from the file system.**
    However, you can enable/disable or hide/show plugins via the admin interface.

If you want to disable the built-in admin site for GDAPS, or provide a custom GDAPS ModelAdmin, you can do this using:

.. code-block:: python

    GDAPS = {
        "ADMIN": False
    }


.. _usage-frontend-support:

Frontend plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The GDAPS frontend module can be extended via plugins, each providing a pluggable frontend for your Django application. See

Signals
^^^^^^^
If you are using Django signals in your plugin, we recommend to put them into a ``signals`` submodule. Import it then from the ``AppConfig.ready()`` method.

.. code-block:: python

        def ready(self):
            # Import signals if necessary:
            from . import signals  # NOQA

.. seealso::
    Don't overuse the ``ready`` method. Have a look at the `Django documentation of ready() <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/applications/#django.apps.AppConfig.ready>`_.
