## About The Project
![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2623563/123547683-5a419d00-d77f-11eb-851d-cb4af8273df9.PNG)

There are many great tools available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a tool which make me a CMake lib and also it does compiles.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions to setting up project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

### Installation

 Install from the git repo
   ```sh
   pip install https://github.com/shajeen/spreadsheet-to-cpplib.git
   ```

 Install from pypi
   ```sh
   pip install spreadSheet-to-cpplib
   ```

### How it works

Just pass file name as input argument, and tool will be promoting couple of question. Just answer **yes** or **no**, rest script take care everything. You may find generated files in output folder.

**example of xlsm**
```sh
spreadsheet-to-cpplib --file="Download-Sample-File-xlsm.xlsm"
```

**example of csv**
```sh
spreadsheet-to-cpplib --file="Download-Sample-File.csv"
```

#### Question that tool promots:

<div class="faq-entry">
  <div class="faq-entry-question"><b>Q::(1) Do you want Mathametical Expression library support for formula calculation ?</b></div>
  <div class="faq-entry-answer">:      If you want C++ Mathematical Expression Toolkit header only library. Then please answer **yes** else **no**.</p></div>
  <div class="faq-entry-question">Q::(2) Configure as header-only library ?</div>
  <div class="faq-entry-answer">:      If you want generated output as header-only. Then please answer **yes** else **no**.</p></div>
  <div class="faq-entry-question">Q::(3) Get default value from formula as double.?</div>
  <div class="faq-entry-answer">:      If you want Formaul to be present as string in generated output. Then please answer **yes** else **no**.</p></div>
  <div class="faq-entry-question">Q::(4) Make string as 0.0?</div>
  <div class="faq-entry-answer">:      If you want any string as zero in generated output. Then please answer **yes** else **no**.</p></div>
</div>
