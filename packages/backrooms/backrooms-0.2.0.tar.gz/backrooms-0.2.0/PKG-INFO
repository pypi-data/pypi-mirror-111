        backrooms was inspired by:
            * backrooms Creepypasta/MEME
            * ASCIIDOTS Esolang
            * CISC Architecture
        
        Backrooms was designed to be:
            * hackable VIA memory overflow attacks, poor error handling, ect.
            * visually pleasing.
            * enjoy able to write small/medium programs.
            * capable to rewrite all of a program at run-time.
