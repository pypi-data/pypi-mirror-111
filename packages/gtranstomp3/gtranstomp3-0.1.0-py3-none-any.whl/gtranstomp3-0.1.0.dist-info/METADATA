gtranstomp3 is a tool that can translate English word or sentence into Traditional Chinese and get the example sentences if existed.
Then combine the text by the order of 3 English word, 1 Chinese word and all example sentences.
After combination, the result will be pronounced by 'Miss Google' and store into mp3 file.

Input can be any type of text file, as long as it can be read.
All the input files must be store in 'input' directory where is the same directory you execute the file.

Batch of copy and paste is available, for example, you can copy the following words or phrases:

old
new
milk
apple
umbrella
momentum
Newton
make up
look into

But the word should be in the next line, otherwise it would be seen as a sentence.

To finish entering, just press enter for none input to start translating and formatting.
The mp3 file will be store in the 'output' directorry, where is the same directory you execute the file.
