# Computer, please explain (plsexplain)

Create an explainable AI dashboard for your machine learning model. plsexplain,
or please, explain is a question that you may want to ask your computer after
you've trained a machine learning model.

## Getting started

You can install this tool as a python package on your machine by using the
following command in your favorite shell:

```shell
pip install plsexplain
```

After you've installed the package, use the following command to get an
explainable AI dashboard for your trained model:

```shell
plsexplain <path-to-model> <path-to-sample-set>
```

Currently, we support models trained with scikit-learn, but we're planning on
supporting tensorflow and pytorch as well.

The sample set, is a small dataset containing samples you want to use in the
dashboard for explanations based on sample data. We only support using
CSV files at the moment.

Please refer to the documentation for more information on how to use the tool
for various types of models and sample datasets.
