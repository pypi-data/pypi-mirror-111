# `potluck`

Code for automatically evaluating Python programming tasks, including a
`flask` WSGI server for handling submissions.

Specifications API design by Peter Mawhorter.

Server design by Peter Mawhorter, Scott Anderson, and Franklyn Turbak.

Based on `codder` program by Ben Wood w/ contributions by Franklyn Turbak
and Peter Mawhorter.


## Dependencies

The core evaluation code depends on the `jinja2` and `pygments` packages.

If you want to run the `potluck_server` WSGI app, you'll also need
`flask` and `flask_cas`. These dependencies are listed in the
distribution files and should be installed automatically if you install
through PyPI.

If you're running the WSGI app on a server without a windowing system but
still want to be able to evaluation submissions that use graphics
(notably submissions which use the `turtle` module), there is support for
using `xvfb-run`.


## Installing

To install from PyPI, run the following command on the command-line:

```sh
python3 -m pip install potluck-eval
```

Confirm installation from within Python by running:

```py
import potluck
```

Once that's done, you can perform a tests on the command-line, but you'll
have to download the source package first:

```sh
python3 -m pip download potluck-eval --no-binary potluck-eval --no-deps
tar -xzf potluck-eval*
cd potluck-eval*
```

Now that you've got the package source, you can use the provided
`potluck_testarea` directory to test things, for example, using the
command-line:

```sh
cd potluck_testarea/test_course/fall2021/
potluck_eval -t functionsTest --rubric
```

That should create a `rubrics/rubric-functionsTest.html` file containing a
blank rubric for the "functionsTest" task. Note that if you get a command not
found error, the `potluck_eval` script might not have been installed
somewhere that's on your command line's path, but you should still be
able to run it directly for testing purposes without figuring that out by
invoking `../../../scripts/potluck_eval`.

To test evaluation, run:

```sh
potluck_eval -t functionsTest -u perfect
```

...which will evaluate the provided test submission for the same task,
creating a report `reports/perfect/functionsTest_TIMESTAMP.html` where
TIMESTAMP is a time-stamp based on when you run the command.

If these two commands work, then `potluck` is properly installed and you
can start figuring out how to set up your own evaluation area and define
your own tasks. The documentation for the `potluck.specifications` module
describes the task-definition process and provides a worked example that
shows off many of the possibilities; you can find that example
specification at:

`potluck_testarea/test_course/fall2021/specs/functionsTest/spec.py`


## Evaluation Setup

Once `potluck` is installed and working , you'll need to set up your own
folder for evaluating submissions. The `potluck_testarea` folder contains
an example of this, including task specifications and example
submissions. You can test things out there, but eventually you'll want to
create your own evaluation directory, which should have at minimum:

- `tasks.json`: This file specifies which tasks exist and how to load
  their specifications, as well as which submitted files to look for and
  evaluate. You can work from the example in
  `potluck_testarea/test_course/fall2021/tasks.json`.
- A `specs` folder with one or more task sub-folders, named by their task
  IDs. Each task sub-folder should have a `spec.py` file that defines the
  task, as well as `starter/` and `soln/` folders which hold starter and
  solution code. These files and folders need to match what's specified
  in `tasks.json`.
- A submissions folder, with per-user submissions folders containing
  per-task folders that have actual submitted files in them. Note that if
  you're going to use the `potluck_server` WSGI app, this can be created
  automatically.

If you're going to use the `potluck_server` WSGI app, your evaluation
directory will also need:

- `potluck-admin.json`: Defines which users have admin privileges and
  allows things like masquerading and time travel. Work from the provided
  example `potluck_testarea/test_course/fall2021/potluck-admin.json`.


## Running `potluck_server`

Note: The potluck server is not fully operational yet.

To set up `potluck_server`, in addition to an evaluation directory set up
as described above, you'll need to create `secret`, `syncauth`, and
`config.py` files in the `potluck_server` directory. The `Makefile` in
that directory can be used to create these if you have `make`; if not,
the first two files are just 16 random bytes in hex format, while the
last file can be created by copying `config.py.example`.

For testing purposes, you will not need to change the `config.py` file
from the defaults supplied in `config.example.py`, but you'll want to
edit it extensively before running the server for real.

Once these three files have been created, from the `potluck_server`
directory you should be able to run:

```py
python -m app
```

to run the WSGI app on a local port in debugging mode. It will print
several messages including a prompt about running without authentication,
and you'll have to press enter to actually start the server, after which
it should provide you with a link you can use in a browser to access it.

NOTE THAT THE POTLUCK WEB APP ALLOWS AUTHENTICATED USERS TO RUN ARBITRARY
PYTHON CODE ON THE SERVER!

In addition to this, in debugging mode the server has no authetication,
and is only protected by the fact that it's only accessible to localhost.
Accordingly, you will need to set up CAS (Central Authentication Server)
via the values in `config.py` to run the server for real. If you don't
have access to a CAS instance via your company or institution, you can
either set one up yourself, or you'll have to modify the server to use
some other form of authentication.

In debugging mode, you will automatically be logged in as the "test"
user, and with the default `potluck-admin.json` file, this will be an
admin account, allowing you to do things like view full feedback before
the submission deadline is past. With the default setup, you should be
able to submit files for the testing tasks, and view the feedback
generated for those files. You can find files to submit in the
`potluck_testarea/test_course/fall2021/submissions/test` directory, and
you can always try submitting some of the solution files.

See the documentation at the top of `python_server/app.py` for a run-down
of how the server works and what's available.

To actually install the server as a WSGI app, you'll need to follow the
standard procedure for whatever HTTP server you're using. For example,
with Apache, this involves installing mod_wsgi and creating various
configuration files. An example Apache mod_wsgi configuration might look
like this (to be placed in `/etc/httpd/conf.d`):

```cfg
# ================================================================
# Potluck App for code submission & grading (runs potluck_eval)

# the following is now necessary in Apache 2.4; the default seems to be to deny.
<Directory "/home/potluck/private/potluck/potluck_server">
    Require all granted
</Directory>

WSGIDaemonProcess potluck user=potluck processes=5 display-name=httpd-potluck home=/home/potluck/private/potluck/potluck_server python-home=/home/potluck/private/potluck-venv python-path=/home/potluck/private/potluck/potluck_server/
WSGIScriptAlias /potluck /home/potluck/private/potluck/potluck_server/potluck.wsgi process-group=potluck
```


## Security

Running the potluck_server WSGI app on a public-facing port represents a
significant security vulnerability, since any authenticated user can
submit tasks, and the evaluation mechanisms currently do not use any
sandboxing, meaning that they RUN UNTRUSTED PYTHON CODE DIRECTLY ON YOUR
SERVER (even if they used sandboxing, which is a target feature for the
future, they would be vulnerable to any means of circumventing the
sandboxing used).

You therefore need to trust that your CAS setup is secure, and trust that
your users will be responsible about submitting files and about keeping
their accounts secure. If you can't depend on these things, DO NOT run
the web app.

Even if you do not run the web app, and instead collect submissions via
some other mechanism, the evaluation machinery still runs submitted code
directly. You will need to trust the users submitting tasks for
evaluation, and watch out for accidental mis-use of resources (e.g.,
creating files in an infinite loop). It's not a bad idea to run the
entire evaluation process in a virtual machine, although the details of
such a setup are beyond this document.

You can also read the same documentation in the docstrings of the source
code, or compile it yourself if you've got `pdoc` installed by running
the `makedoc.sh` script on the command-line.
