**Optical Character Recognition made seamless & accessible to anyone, powered by TensorFlow 2 (PyTorch in beta)**


What you can expect from this repository:
- efficient ways to parse textual information (localize and identify each word) from your documents
- guidance on how to integrate this in your current architecture

## Quick Tour

### Getting your pretrained model

End-to-End OCR is achieved in DocTR using a two-stage approach: text detection (localizing words), then text recognition (identify all characters in the word).
As such, you can select the architecture used for [text detection](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/latest/models.html#id2), and the one for [text recognition](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/latest/models.html#id3) from the list of available implementations.

```python
from doctr.models import ocr_predictor

model = ocr_predictor(det_arch='db_resnet50', reco_arch='crnn_vgg16_bn', pretrained=True)
```

### Reading files

Documents can be interpreted from PDF or images:

```python
from doctr.documents import DocumentFile
# PDF
pdf_doc = DocumentFile.from_pdf("path/to/your/doc.pdf").as_images()
# Image
single_img_doc = DocumentFile.from_images("path/to/your/img.jpg")
# Webpage
webpage_doc = DocumentFile.from_url("https://www.yoursite.com").as_images()
# Multiple page images
multi_img_doc = DocumentFile.from_images(["path/to/page1.jpg", "path/to/page2.jpg"])
```

### Putting it together
Let's use the default pretrained model for an example:
```python
from doctr.documents import DocumentFile
from doctr.models import ocr_predictor

model = ocr_predictor(pretrained=True)
# PDF
doc = DocumentFile.from_pdf("path/to/your/doc.pdf").as_images()
# Analyze
result = model(doc)
```

To make sense of your model's predictions, you can visualize them as follows:

```python
result.show(doc)
```

![DocTR example](https://github.com/mindee/doctr/releases/download/v0.1.1/doctr_example_script.gif)

or export them to JSON format (to get a better understanding of our document model, check our [documentation](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/documents.html#document-structure)):

```python
json_output = result.export()
```


## Installation

Python 3.6 (or higher) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) are required to install DocTR. Additionally, you will need to install at least one of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally).

You can then install the latest release of the package using [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/python-doctr/) as follows:

```shell
pip install python-doctr
```

Or you can install it from source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mindee/doctr.git
pip install -e doctr/.
```

Since we use [weasyprint](https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/), you will need extra dependencies if you are not running Linux.
For MacOS users, you can install them as follows:
```shell
brew install cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libffi
```

For Windows users, those dependencies are included in GTK. You can find the latest installer over [here](https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases).


## Models architectures
Credits where it's due: this repository is implementing, among others, architectures from published research papers.

## More goodies

### Documentation

The full package documentation is available [here](https://mindee.github.io/doctr/) for detailed specifications.


### Demo app

A minimal demo app is provided for you to play with the text detection model!

You will need an extra dependency ([Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)) for the app to run:
```shell
pip install -r demo/requirements.txt
```
You can then easily run your app in your default browser by running:

```shell
streamlit run demo/app.py
```

### Docker container

If you are to deploy containerized environments, you can use the provided Dockerfile to build a docker image:

```shell
docker build . -t <YOUR_IMAGE_TAG>
```

### Example script

An example script is provided for a simple documentation analysis of a PDF or image file:

```shell
python scripts/analyze.py path/to/your/doc.pdf
```
All script arguments can be checked using `python scripts/analyze.py --help`


### Minimal API integration

Looking to integrate DocTR into your API? Here is a template to get you started with a fully working API using the wonderful [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) framework.

#### Deploy your API locally
Specific dependencies are required to run the API template, which you can install as follows:
```shell
pip install -r api/requirements.txt
```
You can now run your API locally:

```shell
uvicorn --reload --workers 1 --host 0.0.0.0 --port=8002 --app-dir api/ app.main:app
```

Alternatively, you can run the same server on a docker container if you prefer using:
```shell
PORT=8002 docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### What you have deployed

Your API should now be running locally on your port 8002. Access your automatically-built documentation at [http://localhost:8002/redoc](http://localhost:8002/redoc) and enjoy your three functional routes ("/detection", "/recognition", "/ocr"). Here is an example with Python to send a request to the OCR route:

```python

import requests
import io
with open('/path/to/your/doc.jpg', 'rb') as f:
    data = f.read()
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8002/ocr", files={'file': io.BytesIO(data)}).json()
```
