# Overview
ebcommander is intended as an interaction layer between Python and EBCommand (https://command.elektrobit.com). It can either be used as a module or directly via Commandline.

## Preconditions
The script depends on the following Python packages
- beautifulsoup4
- requests
- pyyaml

---

## Usage
### Direct call
For simple requests (e.g. just to get a glimpse at a specific file) the script can be called with the following arguments

| Argument   | Description                                       |

### Complex calls
For more versatile operations a config file must provided. It can contain several settings to apply filters on projects, distributions, versions and files, store JSON and YAML files and download the retrieved files. For more information see example-config.yaml
