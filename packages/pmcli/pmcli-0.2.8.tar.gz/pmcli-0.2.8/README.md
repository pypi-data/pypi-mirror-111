else, try the above steps again!

#### Setup

First you need to setup pm for yourself

Procedure:

- Run `pm init` to initialize pm for your directory

There should be no output

- Run `pm config -ps <password>` to set your password for PM. It will ask you for your OLD PASSWORD
  - Now if you haven't configured your passowrd before, enter `fetcher` in the OLD PASSWORD INPUT which is the default password

**NOTE: THIS STORES YOUR PASSWORD FOR PM AND DOES NOT INDICATE A PASSWORD FOR PASSWORD MANAGEMENT**

- Now you are set up to use PM

##### Encryption:

```
pm encrypt {password} {note(optional)}
```

For example:

```
pm encrypt 'Welcome982' -n google
```
Here the password `Welcome982` will be stored in encrypted format and stored in your device.

In the above example, 'google' is an ID that gives the encrypted data and identity.

You can even use `--note` instead of `-n` to add an ID

Giving an ID is completely optional, but highly recommended for every user. This helps you decrypt your messages easily

##### Decryption

There are two methods of decrypting/obtaining your passwords

###### SPECIFIC DECRYPTION

```
pm decrypt -n {note}
```

For example:

```
pm decrypt -n google
```

This gives you the stored password identified by `google` NOTE/ID.

###### MASS DECRYPTION

```
pm decryptf 
```

This gives you all of your stored passwords

```
pm decryptf
```

**NOTE: EVERY DECRYPTION METHOD NEEDS YOUT PM PASSWORD, HENCE IF YOU HAVE NOT SETUP YOUR PM, DECRYPTION WONT WORK**

##### CLEAR

`pm clear` cleans the data from data file
