Description: # APriCOPT#
        
        APriCOPT (Automatic Personalized Combination Therapy Optimizer) is a python library and standalone program for the synthesis of personalized therapies on biological models given as black-boxes, with a focus on SBML models.
        
        It requires little to no programming experience, as it uses [PEtab](https://petab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for describing the problem and providing all the needed information.
        
        APriCOPT natively supports [NOMAD](https://www.gerad.ca/nomad/) for black-box optimization, but any solver can be used by implementing a simple API.
        
        ### SBML models
        
        If the biological model is described in the SBML format, APriCOPT provides immediate ways to setup the therapy synthesis.
        
        Currently, we support the following simulators of SBML models:
        
        * COPASI. A state-of-the-art simulator for models of biological processes. We support any level and version of SBML.
