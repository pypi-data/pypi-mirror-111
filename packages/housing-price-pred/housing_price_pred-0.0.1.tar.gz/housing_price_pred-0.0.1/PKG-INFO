Welcome to housing_price_pred's documentation!
==============================================
The housing data can be downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ageron/handson-ml/master/. The script has codes to download the data. We have modelled the median house value on given housing data. 

The following techniques have been used: 

 - Linear regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest - Both Randomized Search and Grid Search has been done for Hyperparameter Tuning.

The trained models are saved in a specified directory from where they can be used to check the performance on the test set. 

Steps performed
================
 - We prepare and clean the data. We check and impute for missing values.
 - Features are generated and the variables are checked for correlation.
 - Multiple sampling techinuqies are evaluated. The data set is split into train and test.
 - All the above said modelling techniques are tried and evaluated. The final metric used to evaluate is mean squared error.

Install the package
===================
 - Install the package using python3 -m ``python3 -m pip install housing_price_pred``

Usage
=====
 - From Command Prompt type ``python3`` to start Python
 - To check availability inside python type ``help("modules")``. The package should show up in the list.
 - Package majorly contains 3 modules, ingest_data, train and score. Please note the train_data function from train module does not return any object, it simply trains the model on pre-processed data and stores the trained models as pickles inside specified directory. Incase returns are needed, Please raise and issue and this can be fixed.
 - Import the modules from the package ``from housing_price_pred import ingest_data,train,score``.
 - Functions inside these modules can be used with appropriate arguments.
 - For more information on the functions, run ``help(function_name)``.

Here is an usage example:
::

	from housing_price_pred import ingest_data,train,score
	housing, strat_train_set, strat_test_set = download_data(housing_url, housing_path)
	train_data(input_folder=args.input_path,processed_folder,pickle_path)
	lr_predictions, tr_predictions, rnd_forest_predictions, grd_forest_predictions = score_models(processed_folder=\
                                                                                                  pickle_path,\
                                                                                                  output_path
                                                                                                  )

It is recommended to run train_data and score_models with default parameters if ingest_data is run with default parameters.


For Contributors and Development
================================
 - Fork the repo here https://github.com/sibashisc/mle-training/tree/fix/9%2Fml-workflow

 - Create a dev environment using the .yml file
 	- ``conda env create -f env.yml``

 - Activate environment
	- ``conda activate mle-dev``

To excute the script
====================
 - ``python <scriptname.py>``
 - Each script ingest_data.py, train.py and score.py can take user arguments. For more information run ``python3 <scriptname.py> --help``
