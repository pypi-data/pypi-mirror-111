        A little tool to visually browse your console history.

        ### Arguments
        
        | Argument       | Description                                               |
        |----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
        | `-s, --search` | Filter history by regex.                                  |
        | `--c`          | Don't invoke selected command, instead copy to clipboard. |
        
        ## Known Issues
        
        - Still uses `subprocess` to invoke. It should be _mostly_ the same given that environment variables are passed in, but a straightforward return of the command is something that would be better.
        - Only supports Windows and Powershell.
        - Only adds to the long-term history. Not the history of the current shell (available via up/down)
        
        ### Addendum
        
        Yes, I am entirely aware that I could get the same affect in powershell with `Get-History`. Not the point!
