    HV needs to handle two tasks when showing the selected "frame" of data
    from a users history.

    We need to accept written input that:
        a. Reflects the # command in the view pane that we want to keep, an integer followed by an `enter`
        b. Listen for `up`/`left` or `down`/`right` direction commands that change selected frame
        c. Listen for a bare `enter` that takes the currently selected history item.

    Given the fact that we want to handle both the text input AND the keypresses, this will have to be more
    complicated than input() interaction, and as such requires an abstraction layer.
