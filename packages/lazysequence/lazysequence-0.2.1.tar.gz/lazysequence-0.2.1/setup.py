But what if later code needs to see all the items from the iterator? Then you have some options:\n\n1. Pass any consumed items separately. This can get messy, though.\n2. Copy the iterator into a sequence beforehand, if that does not take a lot of space or time.\n3. Duplicate the iterator using `itertools.tee`_, or write your own custom itertool that buffers consumed items internally. There are some good examples of this approach on SO, by `Alex Martelli`_, `Raymond Hettinger`_, and `Ned Batchelder`_.\n\n.. _itertools.tee: https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.tee\n.. _Alex Martelli: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1518097/1355754\n.. _Raymond Hettinger: https://stackoverflow.com/a/15726344/1355754\n.. _Ned Batchelder: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1517965/1355754\n\nA lazy sequence combines advantages from option 2 and option 3. It is an immutable sequence that wraps the iterable and caches consumed items in an internal buffer. By implementing `collections.abc.Sequence`_, lazy sequences provide the full set of sequence operations on the iterable. Unlike a copy (option 2), but like a duplicate (option 3), items are only consumed and stored in memory as far as required for any given operation.\n\n.. _collections.abc.Sequence: https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.Sequence\n\nThere are some caveats:\n\n- The lazy sequence will eventually store all items in memory. If this is a problem, use ``s.release()`` to obtain an iterator over the sequence items without further caching. After calling this function, the sequence should no longer be used.\n- Explicit is better than implicit. Clients may be better off being passed an iterator and dealing with its limitations. For example, clients may not expect ``len(s)`` to incur the cost of consuming the iterator to its end.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYou can install *lazysequence* via pip_ from PyPI_:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   $ pip install lazysequence\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nContributions are very welcome.\nTo learn more, see the `Contributor Guide`_.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nDistributed under the terms of the `MIT license`_,\n*lazysequence* is free and open source software.\n\n\nIssues\n------\n\nIf you encounter any problems,\nplease `file an issue`_ along with a detailed description.\n\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThis project was generated from `@cjolowicz`_\'s `Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter`_ template.\n\n.. _@cjolowicz: https://github.com/cjolowicz\n.. _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n.. _MIT license: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/\n.. _Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter: https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python\n.. _file an issue: https://github.com/cjolowicz/lazysequence/issues\n.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/\n.. github-only\n.. _Contributor Guide: CONTRIBUTING.rst\n.. _Usage: https://lazysequence.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html\n',
