## ðŸ”§ For Package Developers

This repo uses [webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/) with [Babel 7](https://babeljs.io) to compile the React source code located in `src/` into bundled ES5 JS and CSS in `dist/`. The contents of `dist` are used to create an `npm` package for use in other repos.

### Building

To build a new version of the package (without publishing):

```
npm i
npm run bundle
npm pack
```

Running `npm pack` will generate a new `.tar.gz` package locally which can be added to any other repo with `npm install <file location>`. This can be used for testing before publishing a new version.

### Publishing

*Coming soon*

### Development Tools

This repo also uses [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to provide live development previews of the components for testing purposes.

To start the development server:

```
npm i
npm run start
```

To launch Storybook:

```
npm i
npm run storybook
```
