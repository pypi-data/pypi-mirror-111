```

- Run `make env` to set up the local development environment.
- Run `make console` to start a Python interpreter.
- If new requirements are added to the project (see `git log requirements.txt`),
  run `make depsrebuild`.
- Export the environment variables to a file with `make .env`. Use this command
  when integrating with third-party IDEs such as Eclipse or VSCode. Do not check
