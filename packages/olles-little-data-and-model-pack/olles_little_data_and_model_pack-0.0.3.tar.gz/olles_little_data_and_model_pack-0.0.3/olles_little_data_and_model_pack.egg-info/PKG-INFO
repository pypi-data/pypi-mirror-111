Description: 1. # Package to Test Time Series Models
        
           * In the end will provide quick access to standard datasets and basic time series models for benchmarking.
           * Example code is found at the bottom of the readme file. 
           
           ## Datasets
           * All datasets are in list and pandas format.

           ### Univariate Seasonal Data
           #### Monthly Flight Passenger Demand
           
           * Classic dataset with flight passangers over time from the R data package.
           * flight_list = the data in a list format
           * flight_pandas = the data in pandas dataframe format
