## Examples

1) **Simple Example in JupyterLab using Sidecar (light theme)**

    ![Sidecar](screenshots/sidecar.png)

    To try this yourself, you can use the code [here](#example-code)

2) **Animation system in JupyterLab**

    ![Animated Hexapod in Sidecar](screenshots/hexapod-crawling.gif)

3) **Debugging in VS Code with Standalone Viewer (dark theme)**

    ![Sidecar](screenshots/debugging.gif)

    Note:
    - the top half is the standalone viewer in a browser window
    - the bottom half is the CadQuery code being debugged in VS Code
    - The `show` command in the code will tessellate the objects and send them via [zmq](https://pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to the standalone viewer
## Installation

1) **Using conda**

    - Create a conda environment with Jupyterlab:

        - If you don't have it already, create a new conda environment with CadQuery 2.1

            ```bash
            conda create -n jcq22 -c conda-forge -c cadquery python=3.8 cadquery
            conda activate jcq22
            ```

        - Install *Jupyter-CadQuery* (note, matplotlib is only used for the examples)

            ```bash
            pip install jupyter-cadquery==2.2.0 matplotlib
            ```

            Windows users should also install `pywin32` again with `conda` to ensure it is configured correctly

            ```bash
            conda install pywin32
            ```

    - Run *Jupyter-CadQuery* in **JupyterLab**

        ```bash
        conda activate jcq22
        jupyter lab
        ```
        
        If you use the dark theme of JuypterLab, add the following code in the first cell of your notebook:

        ```python
        [1]: from jupyter_cadquery import set_defaults, set_sidecar
             set_defaults(theme="dark")
             set_sidecar("CadQuery", init=True)
        ```

    - Run *Jupyter-CadQuery* as **standalone viewer**

        ```bash
        conda activate jcq22
        jcv     # light theme
        jcv -d  # dark theme
        ```

        In your code import the `show` or `show_object` function from the viewer:

        ```python
        from jupyter_cadquery.viewer.client import show, show_object
        ```

        `show` works as in JupyterLab, while `show_object` views objects incrementally as in CQ-Editor


2) **Using a docker image**

    - Run the docker container (jupyter in the container will start in `/home/cq`)

        ```bash
        WORKDIR=/tmp/jupyter
        mkdir -p "$WORKDIR"  # this has to exist, otherwise an access error will be thrown
        docker run -it --rm -v $WORKDIR:/home/cq -p 8888:8888 bwalter42/jupyter_cadquery:2.2.0
        ```

        Notes: 
        - To start with examples, you can 
            - omit the volume mapping and just run `docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 bwalter42/jupyter_cadquery:2.2.0` or
            - copy the example notebooks to your `$WORKDIR`. They will be available for JupyterLab in the container.
        - If you want to change the Dockerfile, `make docker` will create a new docker image

    - `position`:          Relative camera position that will be scaled (default=(1, 1, 1))
    - `rotation`:          z, y and y rotation angles to apply to position vector (default=(0, 0, 0))
    - `zoom`:              Zoom factor of view (default=2.5)
    - `reset_camera`:      Reset camera position, rotation and zoom to default (default=True)
    - `mac_scrollbar`:     Prettify scrollbars (default=True)

    For example isometric projection can be achieved in two ways:
    - `position = (1, 1, 1)`
    - `position = (0, 0, 1)` and `rotation = (45, 35.264389682, 0)` 
    
### b) Manage default values

- `set_defaults(**kwargs)`: allows to globally set the defaults value so they do not need to be provided with every `show` call

    kwargs: 
    - see `show`

- `get_default(value)`: Get the global default for a single `value`
- `get_defaults()`: Get all global defaults
- `reset_defaults()`: Reset all defaults back to its initial value

### c) Replay objects

Note, this is not supported in the standalone viewer for the time being.

- `replay(args)`

    args:

    - `cad_obj`: cadquery object
    - `index` (`default=0`): Element in the fluent API stack to show
    - `debug` (`default=False`): Trace building the replay stack
    - `cad_width` (`default=600`): Width of the CAD view
    - `height` (`default=600`): Height of the CAD view

### d) Export as HTML:

1. Export full notebook

    In the first cell of the notebook set output to "html"

    ```python
    set_defaults(display="html")
    ```

    and then use JupyterLab's *File -> Export Notebook as ... -> HTML* menu entry

    Notes:
    - `display="html"` will automatically turn off tools
    - Browsers can only a set of 8-16 WebGL contexts. So try to have a small number of renderings. If there are too much, they will be shown as black box, that renders after hovering over it.
    - In JupyterLab the widget state needs to be saved automatically for this to work (menu *Settings -> Save Widget State Automatically*)

2. Export single rendering view

    A straight forward approach is to use

    ```python
    w = show(a1)
    ```

    adapt the cad view as wanted (axis, viewpoint, transparency, ...) and then call

    ```python
    from ipywidgets.embed import embed_minimal_html
    embed_minimal_html('export.html', views=[w.cq_view.renderer], title='Renderer')
    ```

    Using `w.cq_view.renderer` this will save the exact state of the visible pythreejs view.

    Of course, you can also call `w = show(a1, *params)` where `params` is the dict of show parameters you'd like to be used and then call the `embed_minimal_html` with `views=w.cq_view.renderer`

    Notes:

    - If you use `sidecar` then you need to close it first:

        ```python
        from jupyter_cadquery import cad_display
        cad_display.SIDECAR.close()
        ```

    - Buttons and treeview can be exported, however the interaction logic of the UI is implemented in Python. So the treeview and the buttons won't have any effect in an exported HTML page. Best is to set `set_defaults(tools=False)` to omit all buttons and the tree

### e) Export the rendered object as STL:

- OCC

    ```python
    from jupyter_cadquery import exportSTL

    exportSTL(a1, "a1.stl", linear_deflection=0.01, angular_deflection=0.1)
    ```

    Smaller `linear_deflection` and `angular_deflection` means more details.

from jupyter_cadquery.cadquery import (PartGroup, Part, Edges, Faces, Vertices, show)
from jupyter_cadquery import set_sidecar, set_defaults

set_defaults(axes=False, grid=True, axes0=True, ortho=True, transparent=True)
set_sidecar("CadQuery", init=True)

box1 = cq.Workplane('XY').box(10, 20, 30).edges(">X or <X").chamfer(2)
box2 = cq.Workplane('XY').box(8, 18, 28).edges(">X or <X").chamfer(2)
box3 = cq.Workplane('XY').transformed(offset=(0, 15, 7)).box(30, 20, 6).edges(">Z").fillet(3)
box4 = box3.mirror("XY").translate((0, -5, 0))

box1 = box1\
    .cut(box2)\
    .cut(box3)\
    .cut(box4)

a1 = PartGroup(
    [
        Part(box1, "red box",   "#d7191c", show_edges=False),
        Part(box3, "green box", "#abdda4", show_edges=False),
        Part(box4, "blue box",  "#2b83ba", show_faces=False),
    ],
    "example 1"
)

show(a1, grid=False)  # overwrite grid default value
```

## Known issues

- [z-fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting) happens some times, especially when using multiple clip planes (cannot be solved in general)
- Using more than one clip plane will lead to cut surfaces not being shown as solid. (very hard to solve in general)

## History

## Relase v2.1.0 "Performance Release" (07.04.2021)

- **New features**
    - Complete new tessellator class. Significantly faster (for a 15MB STEP file it reduced the rendering time from 3 min to <10 sec)
    - Mesh quality is calculated as in FreeCad (sum of bounding box x-, y-, z-widths divided by 300 times deviation paramter)

- **Changes**
    - Pan speed is adapted to object size sum of bounding box x-, y-, z-widths divided by 300)
    - Replay warnings can be suppressed now (`replay(warning=False)`)
## Release v2.0.0 (06.03.2021)

- **New features**
    - *Jupyter-CadQuery* supports the latest *CadQuery 2.1* with *OCP* (note, it will not run with the *FreeCAD* version of *CadQuery*).
    - Uses JupyterLab 3.0 which has a new extension deployment system which simplifies the installation of `Jupyter-CadQuery` drastically (see below)
    - It supports the new [CadQuery Assemblies](https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/assy.html)
    - Splits UI and shape rendering and shows a progress bar during rendering, especially useful for large assembblies
    - If you install `cadquery-massembly` (see below) then the class `MAssembly` (meaning "Mate base Assembly") is available, which is derived from `cadquery.Assembly` but similar to `cqparts` or FreeCad's `Assembly4` works with mates to manually connect instead of constraints and a numerical solver.
    - Comes with an animation system to simulate models built with `MAssembly`

- **Changes**
    - Deprecates *Jupyter-CadQuery*'s `Assembly` (too many assemblies in the meantime) and has renamed it to `PartGroup` (no semantic change). `Assembly` can still be used with warnings at the moment.
    - Does not test or change the `cqparts` support since the project doesn't seem to be active any more
