""" wrappers.py
Abstract classes for objects that can wrap any objects and make their attributes/methods accessible from the wrapper.

StaticWrapper calls wrapped attributes/methods by creating property descriptor objects for each of the wrapped objects'
attributes/methods. There some limitations to how StaticWapper can be used. First, for any given subclass of
StaticWrapper all object instances must contain the same wrapped object types because descriptor are handled at the
class scope. Second, creating property descriptors does not happen automatically, creation must be invoked though the
_wrap method. This means a subclass must call _wrap to initialize at some point. Also, if the wrapped objects create new
attributes/methods afterwards, then _wrap or _rewrap must be called to add the new attributes/methods. Overall, this
means subclasses should be designed to wrap the same objects and be used to wrap objects that do not create new
attributes/methods after initialization. These limitation are strict, but it leads to great performance preservation
when compared to normal object attribute/method access.

DynamicWrapper calls wrapped attribute methods by changing the __getattribute__ method to check the wrapped classes
after checking itself. This makes DynamicWrapper very flexible with its wrapped objects. DynamicWrapper does not have
any usage limitation, but it is significantly slower than normal object attribute/method access, because it handles
every get, set, and delete. Performance would be better if DynamicWrapper was written in C.

Ultimately, StaticWrapper and DynamicWrapper are solutions for two different case. StaticWrapper should be used when
if the application is within the limitations StaticWrapper has. DynamicWrapper would be used if the application involves
wrapping various indeterminate object types and/or if the objects change available attributes/methods frequently.

Here are some tested relative performance metrics to highlight those differences: let normal attribute access be 1, when
StaticWrapper accesses a wrapped attribute it takes about 1.7 while DynamicWrapper takes about 4.4. StaticWrapper's
performance loss is debatable depending on the application, but DynamicWrapper takes about x4 longer a normal attribute
access which is not great for most applications.

Todo: add magic method support for StaticWrapper and DynamicWrapper (requires thorough method resolution handling)

    Attribute/method resolution of this object will first look with the object itself then it look within the wrapped
    objects' attributes/methods. The resolution order of the wrapped objects is based on _wrap_attributes, first element
    to last.

    This object does not truly use method resolution, but instead creates property descriptors that call the
    attributes/methods of the wrapped objects. To create the property descriptors the _wrap method must be called after
    the objects to wrap are store in this object. Keep in mind, all objects of this class must have the same type of
    wrapped objects, because descriptors are on the class scope. Additionally, this object cannot detect when wrapped
    objects create new or delete attributes/methods. Therefore, subclasses or the user must decide when to call _wrap to
    ensure all the attributes/methods are present. This object is best used to wrap frozen objects or ones that do not
    create or delete attributes/methods after initialization.

    If the objects to wrap can be defined during class instantiation then this class can setup the wrapping by listing
    the types or objects in _wrapped_types. The setup will occur immediately after class instantiation.
