Description: # Snitch AI Python Client Library
        
        This library is used to perform Snitch AI analyses in a programmatic manner. This allows for easier upload
        to the Snitch AI platform without having to use the UI. Additionally, this library can facilitate integration
        with existing MLOps pipelines and external reporting tools.
        
        ##Usage:
        
        ###Generate a quality report
        
        ```
        import snitch_ml
        
        snitch_ml.access_token = "VGhpcyBpcyBub3QgYW4gYWN0dWFsIGFjY2VzcyB0b2tlbi4gVG8gZ2V0I..."
        
        project = snitch_ml.get_or_create_project("My First Project")
        version = project.create_version("My New Version")
        
        quality = version.run_quality_analysis(model, train_x, train_y, test_x, test_y)
        
        json = quality.get_json()
        quality.save_pdf("My Quality Report.pdf")
        ```
        
        ###Generate a drift report
        
        ```
        import snitch_ml
        
        snitch_ml.access_token = "VGhpcyBpcyBub3QgYW4gYWN0dWFsIGFjY2VzcyB0b2tlbi4gVG8gZ2V0I..."
        
        project = snitch_ml.get_or_create_project("My First Project")
        version = project.create_version("My New Version")
        
        drift = version.run_drift_analysis(train_x, updated_x)
        
        json = drift.get_json()
        drift.save_pdf("My Drift Report.pdf")
        ```
        
        ###Usage within a hybrid environment
        
        Snitch AI can also be used in a hybrid environment. This gives you the full power of Snitch AI's analysis
        engine without needing to upload your models or datasets to the cloud. If your internal security policy
        forbids uploading your data to a public cloud, this will likely be your preferred method of using Snitch AI.

        ```
        import snitch_ml
        
        # replace this address with the address of your on-premises Snitch AI environment
        snitch_ml.endpoint_address = "https://hybridenvironment.local:8443/"
        snitch_ml.access_token = "VGhpcyBpcyBub3QgYW4gYWN0dWFsIGFjY2VzcyB0b2tlbi4gVG8gZ2V0I..."
        
        # perform quality or drift analysis per usual
        
        ```
