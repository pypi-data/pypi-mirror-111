# hivae

This repository contains the Modular reimplemenation of the Heterogeneous Incomplete Variational Autoencoder model (HI-VAE)written by Alfredo Nazabal and co-workers.
The package provided here is to a large part baseed on this implementation, but adheres to a more pythonic way, omitting the need for supplying parameters via I/O , as well as aligning the modelling more with sklearn.
It was written by A. Karwath (a.karwath@bham.ac.uk) and the CardAIc group @ University of Birmingham.

The details of the background of this model are included in this [paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2020.107501). 

## Install

The package can be installed using pip:

```pip install hivae```


## Examples

Once checked out, there are a number of example datasets (Wine, Adult and Diabetes), which can be found in ./hivae/examples/data. To evaluate the package, please use ./hivae/examples/hivae_general_example.py. The example should give a general explaination of how to use the package. More details will folow.


## Files description


* **hivae.py**: The main script of the library, it needs to imported to work with the library and is connected to all the other scripts.
* **loglik_ models_ missing_normalize.py**: In this file, the different likelihood models for the different types of variables considered (real, positive, count, categorical and ordinal) are included.
* **model_ HIVAE_inputDropout.py**: Contains the HI-VAE with input dropout encoder model.
* **model_ HIVAE_factorized.py**: Contains the HI-VAE with factorized encoder model
* **Github page with examples to follow**:
