# Unleaky

##### A Simple Cli Password Manager

Unleaky is a simple Cli password manager that stores all your passwords in a database file.
Unleaky can be installed with pip but the recommended way to use it is either downloading the raw script or using the handy executable provided in the [github](https://github.com/newtoallofthis123/unleaky) page.
You can use Unleaky with many handy commands.

1. read - View all the passwords
2. new - Add a new entry
3. update - update an Entry
4. clear - Clear the screen
5. quit - securely quit the application by clearing the screen
6. admin - to change the master password

The Default Master Password is '**HelloWorld**'. 
Once you login in for the first time, command the action admin and change the Master Password.
It is recommended to use the quit option to quit Unleaky becuase it clears the screen of all the passwords printed in the terminal.
*Warning*: Unleaky is very secure to store passwords but I don't recommend this for actulal use. 
Just use it for fun and not very important accounts.
