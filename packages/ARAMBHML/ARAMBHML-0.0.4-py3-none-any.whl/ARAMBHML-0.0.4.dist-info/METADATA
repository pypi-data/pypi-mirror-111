# Auto ML for Solving Classification Problems for Tabular Data

[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)                 
[![Python 3.6](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/)   


## Functionality of the Auto ML Framework

- Detects the type of problem from the given target feature
- Does EDA on it's own
- Finds out if there are null values present or not
- If null values are present they are treated specifically with the class they are present in
- Forms train-test split on it's own
- Applies 6 ML models to show the use which model performs the best

## Usage

- Make sure you have Python installed in your system.
- Run Following command in the CMD.
 ```
  pip install ARAMBHML
  ```
## Example


# test.py
from ARAMBHML import get_model_info

## Make sure all the folders are there 
dataframe_dir = 'path/of/dataframe_dir'
Run get_model_info(dataframe dir)

## Note 
- I have tried to implement all the functionality, it might have some bugs also. Ignore that or please try to solve that bug.
