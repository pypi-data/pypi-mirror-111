To initialise this object, it is required to know the IP address of the Misty robot that should be used.\n\nThe most direct way to initialise a `Misty` object is to use the IP address directly, which allows the user to get the object in one step via:\n\n``` python\nfrom misty2py.robot import Misty\n\nmy_misty = Misty("192.168.0.1")  #example IP address\n```\n\nThis may be impractical and potentially even unsafe, so it is recommended to create a .env file in the project\'s directory, specify the IP address there via `MISTY_IP_ADDRESS="[ip_address_here]"` and use Misty2py\'s `EnvLoader` to load the IP address via:\n\n\n``` python\nfrom misty2py.robot import Misty\nfrom misty2py.utils.env_loader import EnvLoader\n\nenv_loader = EnvLoader()\nmy_misty = Misty(env_loader.get_ip())\n```\n\nAssuming a `Misty` object called `my_misty` was obtained, all required actions can be performed via the following three methods:\n\n``` python\n# Performing an action (a POST or DELETE request):\nmy_misty.perform_action("<action_keyword>")\n\n# Obtaining information (a GET request):\nmy_misty.get_info("<information_keyword>")\n\n# Event related methods \n# (subscribing to an event, getting event data\n# or event log and unsubscribing from an event):\nmy_misty.event("<parameter>")\n```\n\n### Responses\n\nAny action performed via Misty2py which contains communication with Misty\'s APIs returns the `Misty2pyResponse` object. `Misty2pyResponse` is a uniform representation of two sub-responses that are present in any HTTP or WebSocket communication with Misty\'s APIs using Misty2py. The first sub-response is always from Misty2py and is represented by the attributes `Misty2pyResponse.misty2py_status` (`True` if no Misty2py-related errors were encountered) and potentially empty `Misty2pyResponse.error_msg` and `Misty2pyResponse.error_type` that contain error information if a Misty2py-related error was encountered. The other sub-response is either from Misty\'s REST API or Misty\'s WebSocket API. In the first case, it is represented by the attribute `Misty2pyResponse.rest_response` (Dict), and in the second case, it is represented by the attribute `Misty2pyResponse.ws_response`. One of these is always empty, because no action in Misty2py includes simultaneous communication with both APIs. For convenience, a `Misty2pyResponse` object can be easily parsed to a dictionary via the method `Misty2pyResponse.parse_to_dict`.\n\n### Obtaining information\n\nObtaining digital information is handled by `misty2py.robot::get_info` method which has two arguments. The argument `info_name` is required and it specifies the string information keyword corresponding to an endpoint in Misty\'s REST API. The argument `params` is optional and it supplies a dictionary of parameter name and parameter value pairs. This argument defaults to `{}` (an empty dictionary).\n\n### Performing actions\n\nPerforming physical and digital actions including removal of non-system files is handled by `misty2py.robot::perform_action()` method which takes two arguments. The argument `action_name` is required and it specifies the string action keyword corresponding to an endpoint in Mistyâ€™s REST API. The second argument, `data`, is optional and it specifies the data to pass to the request as a dictionary or a data shortcut (string). The `data` argument defaults to `{}` (an empty dictionary).\n\n### Event types\n\nMisty\'s WebSocket API follows PUB-SUB architecture, which means that in order to obtain event data in Misty\'s framework, it is required to **subscribe** to an event type on Misty\'s WebSocket API. The WebSocket server then streams data to the WebSocket client, which receives it a separate thread. To **access the data,** `misty2py.robot::event` method must be called with `"get_data"` parameter from the main thread. When the data are no longer required to be streamed to the client, an event type can be **unsubscribed** which both kills the event thread and stops the API from sending more data.\n\n**Subscribing** to an event is done via `misty2py.robot::event` with the parameter `"subscribe"` and following keyword arguments:\n\n- `type` - *required;* event type string as documented in [Event Types Docs](https://docs.mistyrobotics.com/misty-ii/robot/sensor-data/ "Misty Robotics Event Types").\n- `name` - *optional;* a custom event name string; must be unique.\n- `return_property` - *optional;* the property to return from Misty\'s websockets; all properties are returned if return_property is not supplied.\n- `debounce` - *optional;* the interval in ms at which new information is sent; defaults to `250`.\n- `len_data_entries` - *optional;* the maximum number of data entries to keep (discards in fifo style); defaults to `10`.\n- `event_emitter` - *optional;* an event emitter function which emits an event upon message recieval. Supplies the message content as an argument.\n\n**Accessing the data** of an event or its log is done via `misty2py.robot::event` with the parameter `"get_data"` or `"get_log"` and a keyword argument `name` (the name of the event).\n\n**Unsubscribing** from an event is done via `misty2py.robot::event` with the parameter `"unsubscribe"` and a keyword argument `name` (the name of the event).\n\nA bare-bones implementation of event subscription can be seen below.\n\n```python\nimport time\n\nfrom misty2py.robot import Misty\nfrom misty2py.utils.env_loader import EnvLoader\n\nenv_loader = EnvLoader\n\nm = Misty(env_loader.get_ip())\n\nd = m.event("subscribe", type = "BatteryCharge")\ne_name = d.get("event_name")\n\ntime.sleep(1)\n\nd = m.event("get_data", name = e_name)\n\nd = m.event("unsubscribe", name = e_name)\n```\n\nThe following example shows a more realistic scenario which includes an event emitter and an event listener.\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom pymitter import EventEmitter\n\nfrom misty2py.robot import Misty\nfrom misty2py.utils.env_loader import EnvLoader\n\nenv_loader = EnvLoader\n\nm = Misty(env_loader.get_ip())\nee = EventEmitter()\nevent_name = "myevent_001"\n\n@ee.on(event_name)\ndef listener(data):\n    print(data)\n\nd = m.event("subscribe", type = "BatteryCharge", \n            name = event_name, event_emitter = ee)\n\ntime.sleep(2)\n\nd = m.event("unsubscribe", name = event_name)\n```\n\n### Adding custom keywords and shortcuts\n\nCustom keywords and shortcuts can be passed to a Misty object while declaring a new instance by using the optional arguments `custom_info`, `custom_actions` and `custom_data`. \n\nThe argument `custom_info` can be used to pass custom information keywords as a dictionary with keys being the information keywords and values being the endpoints. An information keyword can only be used for a `GET` method supporting endpoint.\n\nThe argument `custom_actions` can be used to pass custom action keywords as a dictionary with keys being the action keywords and values being a dictionary of an `"endpoint"` key (str) and a `"method"` key (str). The `"method"` values must be one of `post`, `delete`, `put`, `head`, `options` and `patch`. However, it should be noted that Misty\'s REST API currently only has `GET`, `POST` and `DELETE` methods. The rest of the methods was implement in Misty2py for forwards-compatibility.\n\nThe argument `custom_data` can be used to pass custom data shortcuts as a dictionary with keys being the data shortcuts and values being the dictionary of data values.\n\nFor futher illustration, an example of passing custom keywords and shortcuts can be seen below.\n\n```python\ncustom_allowed_infos = {\n    "hazards_settings": "api/hazards/settings"\n}\n\ncustom_allowed_data = {\n    "amazement": {\n        "FileName": "s_Amazement.wav"\n    },\n    "red": {\n        "red": "255",\n        "green": "0",\n        "blue": "0"\n    }\n}\n\ncustom_allowed_actions = {\n    "audio_play" : {\n        "endpoint" : "api/audio/play",\n        "method" : "post"\n    },\n    "delete_audio" : {\n        "endpoint" : "api/audio",\n        "method" : "delete"\n    }\n}\n\nmisty_robot = Misty("0.0.0.0", \n    custom_info=custom_allowed_infos, \n    custom_actions=custom_allowed_actions, \n    custom_data=custom_allowed_data)\n```',
