## installation


execute the following command to use the ae.enaml_app sub-package in your
application. it will install ae.enaml_app into your python (virtual) environment:
 
```shell script
pip install ae-enaml-app
```

if you instead want to contribute to this portion then first fork
[the ae_enaml_app repository at GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ae-group/ae_enaml_app "ae.enaml_app code repository"),
then pull it to your machine and finally execute the following command in the root folder
of this repository (ae_enaml_app):

```shell script
pip install -e .[dev]
```

the last command will install this sub-package portion into your virtual environment, along with
the tools you need to develop and run tests or to extend the portion documentation.
to contribute only to the unit tests or to the documentation of this portion replace
the setup extras key `dev` in the above command with `tests` or `docs` respectively.
