# MonochroMap

A compact library to paint and plot black and white map. Inspired and continued from [StaticMap](https://github.com/komoot/staticmap).


## Example
### Draw Lines
This example code will show the location of Laugh Tale from intersection of coordinates given by road poneglyph.

```python
m = MonochroMap()
line = Line(((13.4, 52.5), (2.3, 48.9)), '#ff000088', 15)
m.add_feature(line)

line = Line(((4.9041, 52.3676), (7.27, 46.57)), '#0000ff88', 15)
m.add_feature(line)
image = m.render()
```
