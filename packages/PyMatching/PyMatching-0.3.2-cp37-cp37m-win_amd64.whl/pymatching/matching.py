                 precompute_shortest_paths=False):
        r"""Constructor for the Matching class

        Parameters
        ----------
        H : `scipy.spmatrix` or `numpy.ndarray` or `networkx.Graph` object
            The quantum code to be decoded with minimum-weight perfect
            matching, given either as a binary check matrix (scipy sparse 
            matrix or numpy.ndarray), or as a matching graph (NetworkX graph).
            If `H` is given as a NetworkX graph with `M` nodes, each node 
            `m` in `H` should be an integer :math:`0<m<M-1`, and each node should 
            be unique. Each edge in the NetworkX graph can have optional 
            attributes ``qubit_id``, ``weight`` and ``error_probability``. 
            ``qubit_id`` should be an int or a set of ints. If there 
            are :math:`N` qubits then the union of all ints in the ``qubit_id`` 
            attributes in the graph should be the integers :math:`0\ldots N-1`.  
            Each ``weight`` attribute should be a non-negative float. If 
            every edge is assigned an error_probability between zero and one, 
            then the ``add_noise`` method can be used to simulate noise and 
            flip edges independently in the graph.
        spacelike_weights : float or numpy.ndarray, optional
            If `H` is given as a scipy or numpy array, `spacelike_weights` gives the weights
            of edges in the matching graph. By default None, in which case 
            all weights are set to 1.0
        error_probabilities : float or numpy.ndarray, optional
            The probabilities with which an error occurs on each qubit. If a 
            single float is given, the same error probability is used for each 
            qubit. If a numpy.ndarray of floats is given, it must have a 
            length equal to the number of qubits. This parameter is only 
            needed for the Matching.add_noise method, and not for decoding. 
            By default None
        repetitions : int, optional
            The number of times the stabiliser measurements are repeated, if 
            the measurements are noisy. This option is only used if `H` is 
            provided as a check matrix, not a NetworkX graph. By default None
        timelike_weights : float, optional
            If `H` is given as a scipy or numpy array and `repetitions>1`, 
            `timelike_weights` gives the weight of timelike edges. By default 
            None, in which case all weights are set to 1.0
        measurement_error_probability : float, optional
            If `H` is given as a scipy or numpy array and `repetitions>1`, 
            gives the probability of a measurement error to be used for 
            the add_noise method. By default None
        precompute_shortest_paths : bool, optional
            It is almost always recommended to leave this as False. If 
            the exact matching is used for decoding (setting 
            `num_neighbours=None` in `decode`), then setting this option
            to True will precompute the all-pairs shortest paths.
