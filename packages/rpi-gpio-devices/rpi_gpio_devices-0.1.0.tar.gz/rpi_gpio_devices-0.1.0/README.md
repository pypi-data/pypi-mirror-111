# rpi-gpio-devices

This module provides an abstraction layer to control connected devices
(fans, switches, LEDs, buttons) more easily with ready to use device classes and functions.

It uses the [RPi.GPIO](https://pypi.org/project/RPi.GPIO) module to control the GPIO pins.
Currently this is the recommended module to use for archlinuxarm, but it only provides
basic functions to manipulate the pins.

## Installation

`pip install rpi_gpio_devices`

[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/rpi_gpio_devices)

## Few examples

#### Automatic fan control based on CPU temp
``` py
from time import sleep
from rpi_gpio_devices import Fan


# Basic usage
pwm_fan = Fan(power=29, sense=35, pwm=33)

try:
    while True:
        pwm_fan.auto_set()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pwm_fan.cleanup()
```

#### Set LED brightness with PWM
``` py
from time import sleep
from rpi_gpio_devices import PWMLED


PWMLED1 = PWMLED(33)

PWMLED1.set_brightness(50)
sleep(2)
PWMLED1.set_brightness(100)
sleep(2)
PWMLED1.set_brightness(0)
# PWMLED1.turn_off() # Or simply just turn it off

PWMLED1.cleanup()
```

#### Check if a button is pressed
``` py
from time import sleep
from rpi_gpio_devices import Button


Button1 = Button(11)

try:
    while True:
        if Button1.is_pressed():
            print('Button1 is pressed!')
        sleep(0.5)
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    Button1.cleanup()
```
