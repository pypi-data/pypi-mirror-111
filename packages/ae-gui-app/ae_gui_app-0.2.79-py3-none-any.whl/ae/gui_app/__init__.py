"""
base class for python applications with a graphical user interface
==================================================================

The abstract base class :class:`MainAppBase` provided by this ae namespace portion allows the integration of any Python
GUI framework into the ae namespace.

On overview about the available GUI-framework-specific ae namespace portion implementations can be found in the
documentation of the ae namespace portion :mod:`ae.lisz_app_data`.


extended console application environment
----------------------------------------

The abstract base class :class:`MainAppBase` inherits directly from the ae namespace class
:class:`ae console application environment class <ae.console.ConsoleApp>`. The so inherited helper methods are useful
to log, configure and control the run-time of your GUI app via command line arguments.

.. hint::
    Please see the documentation of :ref:`config-options` and :ref:`config-files` in the :mod:`ae.console` namespace
    portion/module for more detailed information.

:class:`MainAppBase` adds on top of the :class:`~ae.console.ConsoleApp` the concepts of :ref:`application status` and
:ref:`application flow`, explained further down.


application events
------------------

The events described in this section are fired on application startup and shutdown. Additional events get fired e.g. in
relation to the app states (documented further down in the section :ref:`app state events`) or on start or stop of an
:ref:`app tour <app tour start and stop events>`.

The following application events are fired exactly one time at startup in the following order:

* `on_app_init`: fired **after** :class:`ConsoleApp` app instance got initialized (detected config files)
  and **before** the image and sound resources and app states get loaded and the GUI framework app class instance gets
  initialized.
* `on_app_start`: fired **after** the call of the method :meth:`~MainAppBase.run_app` and **before** the command line
  options get parsed.
* `on_app_run`: fired **after** the parsing of the command line arguments and options and **before** all portion
  resources got imported.
* `on_app_build`: fired **after** all portion resources got loaded/imported and **before** the framework event
  loop of the used GUI framework gets started.

.. note::
    The `on_app_build` application event has to be fired by the used GUI framework.

.. hint::
    Depending on the used gui framework there can be more app start events. E.g. the :mod:`ae.kivy_app` module fires the
    events `on_app_built` and `on_app_started` (all of them fired after `on_app_run` and `on_app_build`). See also
    :ref:`kivy application events`.


When an application gets stopped then the following events get fired in the following order:

* `on_app_stop`: fired **after** the call of the method :meth:`~MainAppBase.stop_app` and **before** the framework win
  will be closed.
* `on_app_exit`: fired **after* framework win got closed and just **before** the event loop of the GUI framework will be
  stopped and the app shutdown.
* `on_app_quit`: fired **after** the event loop of the GUI framework got stopped and before the :meth:`AppBase.shutdown`
  method will be called.

.. note::
    The `on_app_stop` and `on_app_exit` events will only be fired if the app is explicitly calling the
    :meth:`~MainAppBase.stop_app` method.

.. hint::
    Depending on the used gui framework there can be more events. E.g. the :mod:`ae.kivy_app` module fires the event
    `on_app_stopped` (before `on_app_stop` respectively `on_app_quit`).


application status
------------------

Any application- and user-specific configurations like e.g. the last window position/size, the app theme/font/language
or the last selected flow within your app, could be included in the application status.

This namespace portion introduces the section `aeAppState` in the app :ref:`config-files`, where any status values can
be stored persistently to be recovered on the next startup of your application.

.. hint::
    The section name `aeAppState` is declared by the :data:`APP_STATE_SECTION_NAME` constant. If you need to access this
    config section directly then please use this constant instead of the hardcoded section name.


.. _app-state-variables:

app state variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module is providing/pre-defining the following application state variables:

    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.app_state_version`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.flow_id`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.flow_id_ink`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.flow_path`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.flow_path_ink`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.font_size`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.lang_code`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.light_theme`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.selected_item_ink`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.sound_volume`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.unselected_item_ink`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.vibration_volume`
    * :attr:`~MainAppBase.win_rectangle`

Which app state variables are finally used by your app project is (fully data-driven) depending on the app state
:ref:`config-variables` detected in all the :ref:`config-files` that are found/available at run-time of your app. The
names of all the available application state variables can be determined with the main app helper method
:meth:`~MainAppBase.app_state_keys`.

If your application is e.g. supporting a user-defined font size, using the provided/pre-defined app state variable
:attr:`~MainAppBase.font_size`, then it has to call the method :meth:`change_app_state` with the argument of
:paramref:`~MainAppBase.change_app_state.app_state_name` set to `font_size` every time when the user has changed the
font size of your app.

.. hint::
    The two built-in app state variables are :attr:`~MainAppBase.flow_id` and :attr:`~MainAppBase.flow_path` will be
    explained detailed in the next section.

The :meth:`~MainBaseApp.load_app_states` method is called on instantiation from the implemented main app class to
load the values of all app state variables from the :ref:`config-files`, and is then calling
:meth:~MainAppBase.setup_app_states` for pass them into their corresponding instance attributes.

Use the main app instance attribute to read/get the actual value of a single app state variable. The actual values of
all app state variables as a dict is determining the method :meth:`~MainBaseApp.retrieve_app_states`, and can be saved
into the :ref:`config-files` for the next app run via the method :meth:`~MainBaseApp.save_app_states` - this could be
done e.g. after the app state has changed or at least on quiting the application.

Changed app state values have to be saved always by calling the method :meth:`~MainBaseApp.change_app_state` (which
ensures (1) the propagation to any duplicated (observable/bound) framework property and (2) the event notification to
related the main app instance method).


.. _app-state-constants:

app state constants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module is also providing some pre-defined constants that can be optionally used in your application in relation to
the app states data store and for the app state config variables :attr:`~MainAppBase.app_state_version`,
:attr:`~MainAppBase.font_size` and :attr:`~MainAppBase.light_theme`:

    * :data:`APP_STATE_SECTION_NAME`
    * :data:`APP_STATE_VERSION_VAR_NAME`
    * :data:`MIN_FONT_SIZE`
    * :data:`MAX_FONT_SIZE`
    * :data:`THEME_LIGHT_BACKGROUND_COLOR`
    * :data:`THEME_LIGHT_FONT_COLOR`
    * :data:`THEME_DARK_BACKGROUND_COLOR`
    * :data:`THEME_DARK_FONT_COLOR`


app state events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three types of notification events get fired in relation to the app state variables, using the method names:

* `on_<app_state_name>`: fired if the user of the app is changing the value of an app state variable.
* `on_<app_state_name>_save`: fired if a app state gets saved to the config file.
* `on_app_state_version_upgrade`: fired if the user upgrades an previously installed app to a higher version.

The method name of the app state change notification event consists of the prefix ``on_`` followed by the variable name
of the app state. So e.g. on a change of the `font_size` app state the notification event `on_font_size` will be
fired/called (if exists as a method of the main app instance). These events don't provide any event arguments.

The second event gets fired for each app state value just after the app states getting retrieved from the app class
instance and before they get stored into the main config file. The method name of this event includes also the name of
the app state with the suffix `_save`, so e.g. for the app state `flow_id` the event method name will result in
:meth:`on_app_state_flow_id_save`. This event is providing one event argument with the value of the app state. If the
event method returns a value that is not `None` then this value will be stored/saved.

The third event gets fired on app startup when the app got upgraded to a higher version of the app state variable
APP_STATE_VERSION_VAR_NAME (`app_state_version`). It will be called providing the version number for each version to
upgrade, starting with the version of the previously installed main config file, until the upgrade version of the main
config file get reached. So if e.g. the previously installed app state version was 3 and the new version number is
6 then this event will be fired 3 times with the argument 3, 4 and 5. It can be used e.g. to change or add app state
variables or to adapt the app environment.


application flow
----------------

to control the current state and application/work flow (or context) of your application, and to persist it until the
next app start, :class:`MainBaseApp` provides two :ref:`app-state-variables`: :attr:`~MainAppBase.flow_id` to store the
currently working flow and :attr:`~MainAppBase.flow_path` to store the history of nested flows.

A application flow is represented by an id string that defines three things: (1) the action to enter into the flow, (2)
the data or object that gets currently worked on and (3) an optional key string that is identifying/indexing a widget or
data item of your application context/flow.

.. note::
    Never concatenate a flow id string manually, use the :func:`id_of_flow` function instead.

The flow id is initially an empty string. As soon as the user is starting a new work flow or the current selection your
application should call the method :meth:`~MainBaseApp.change_flow` passing the flow id string into the
:paramref:`~MainAppBase.change_flow.new_flow_id` argument to change the app flow.

For more complex applications you can specify a path of nested flows. This flow path gets represented by the app state
variable :attr:`~MainAppBase.flow_path`, which is a list of flow id strings.

to enter into a deeper/nested flow you simply call :meth:`~MainBaseApp.change_flow` with one of the actions defined
in :data:`ACTIONS_EXTENDING_FLOW_PATH`.

to go back to a previous flow in the flow path call :meth:`~MainBaseApp.change_flow` passing one of the actions
defined in :data:`ACTIONS_REDUCING_FLOW_PATH`.


application flow change events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The flow actions specified by :data:`ACTIONS_CHANGING_FLOW_WITHOUT_CONFIRMATION` don't need a flow change confirmation
event handler:

* `'enter'` or `'leave'` extend/reduce the flow path.
* `'focus'` pass/change the input focus.
* `'suggest'` for autocompletion or other suggestions.

All other flow actions need to confirmed to be changed by :meth:`~MainAppBase.change_flow`, either by a custom flow
change confirmation method/event-handler or by declaring a popup class that has the same name returned by
:func:`flow_popup_class_name` if called with the new flow id.

The name of the flow change confirmation method that gets fired when the app want to change the flow (via the method
:meth:`~MainAppBase.change_flow`) depends on the new flow id and gets determined by the function
:func:`flow_change_confirmation_event_name`.

If the flow-specific change confirmation event handler does not exist or returns in a boolean `False` or `None` then
:meth:`~MainAppBase.on_flow_change` will be called. And if this call also returns `False` then the action of the new
flow id will be searched within :data:`ACTIONS_CHANGING_FLOW_WITHOUT_CONFIRMATION` and if not found then the flow change
will be rejected and :meth:`~MainAppBase.change_flow` returns `False`.

If in contrary either the flow change confirmation event handler exists and does return `True` or
:meth:`~MainAppBase.on_flow_change` returns True or the flow action of the new flow id is in
:data:`ACTIONS_CHANGING_FLOW_WITHOUT_CONFIRMATION` then the flow id and path will be changed accordingly.

After the flow id/path change confirmation the method :meth:`~MainAppBase.change_flow` checks if the optional
event_kwargs key `changed_event_name` got specified and if yes then it calls this method.

Finally if a confirmed flow change results in a `'focus'` flow action then the event `on_flow_widget_focused` will be
fired. This event can be used by the GUI framework to set the focus to the widget associated with the new focus flow id.


key press events
----------------

to provide key press events to the applications that will use the new GUI framework you have to catch the key press
events of the framework, convert/normalize them and then call the :meth:`~MainAppBase.key_press_from_framework` with the
normalized modifiers and key args.

The :paramref:`~MainAppBase.key_press_from_framework.modifiers` arg is a string that can contain several of the
following sub-strings, always in the alphabetic order (like listed below):

* Alt
* Ctrl
* Meta
* Shift

The :paramref:`~MainAppBase.key_press_from_framework.key` arg is a string that is specifying the last pressed key. If
the key is not representing not a single character but a command key, then `key` will be one of the following strings:

* escape
* tab
* backspace
* enter
* del
* enter
* up
* down
* right
* left
* home
* end
* pgup
* pgdown

On call of :meth:`~MainAppBase.key_press_from_framework` this method will try to dispatch the key press event to your
application. First it will check the app instance if it has declared a method with the name
`on_key_press_of_<modifiers>_<key>` and if so it will call this method.

If this method does return False (or any other value resulting in False) then method
:meth:`~MainAppBase.key_press_from_framework` will check for a method with the same name in lower-case and if exits it
will call this method.

If also the second method does return False, then it will try to call the event method `on_key_press` of the app
instance (if exists) with the modifiers and the key as arguments.

If the `on_key_press` method does also return False then :meth:`~MainAppBase.key_press_from_framework` will finally pass
the key press event to the original key press handler of the GUI framework for further processing.


integrate new gui framework
---------------------------

to integrate a new Python GUI framework you have to declare a new class that inherits from :class:`MainAppBase` and
implements at least the abstract method :meth:`~MainAppBase.init_app`.

Additionally and to load the resources of the app (after the portions resources got loaded) the event `on_app_build` has
to be fired, executing the :meth:`MainAppBase.on_app_build` method. This could be done directly from within
:meth:`~MainAppBase.init_app` or by redirecting one of the events of the app instance of the GUI framework.

A minimal implementation of the :meth:`~MainAppBase.init_app` method would look like the following::

    def init_app(self):
        self.call_method('on_app_build')
        return None, None

Most GUI frameworks are providing classes that need to be instantiated on application startup, like e.g. the instance of
the GUI framework app class, the root widget or layout of the main GUI framework window(s). to keep a reference to
these instances within your main app class you can use the attributes :attr:`~MainAppBase.framework_app`,
:attr:`~MainAppBase.framework_root` and :attr:`~MainAppBase.framework_win` of the class :class:`MainAppBase`.

The initialization of the attributes :attr:`~MainAppBase.framework_app`, :attr:`~MainAppBase.framework_root` and
:attr:`~MainAppBase.framework_win` is optional and can be done e.g. within :meth:`~MainAppBase.init_app` or in the later
called `on_app_build` application event fired by the framework app instance.

.. note::
    If :attr:`~MainAppBase.framework_win` is set to a window instance, then the window instance has to provide a `close`
    method, which will be called automatically by the :meth:`~MainAppBase.stop_app`.

A typical implementation of a framework-specific main app class looks like::

    from new_gui_framework import NewFrameworkApp, MainWindowClassOfNewFramework

    class NewFrameworkMainApp(MainAppBase):
        def init_app(self):
            self.framework_app = NewFrameworkAppClass()
            self.framework_win = MainWindowClassOfNewFramework()

            # return callables to start/stop the event loop of the GUI framework
            return self.framework_app.start, self.framework_app.stop

In this example the `on_app_build` application event gets fired either from within the `start` method of the framework
app instance or by an event provided by the GUI framework.

:meth:`~MainAppBase.init_app` will be executed only once at the main app class instantiation. Only the main app instance
has to initialize the GUI framework to prepare the app startup and has to return at least a callable to start the event
loop of the GUI framework.

.. hint::
    Although not recommended because of possible namespace conflicts, one could e.g. alternatively integrate the
    framework application class as a mixin to the main app class.

to initiate the app startup the :meth:`~MainAppClass.run_app` method has to be called from the main module of your
app project. :meth:`~MainAppBase.run_app` will then start the GUI event loop by calling the first method that got
returned by :meth:`~MainAppBase.init_app`.


optional configuration and extension
------------------------------------

Most of the base implementation helper methods can be overwritten by either the inheriting framework portion or directly
by user main app class.


base resources for your gui app
-------------------------------

This portion is also providing base resources for commonly used images and sounds.

The image file resources provided by this portion are taken from:

* `iconmonstr <https://iconmonstr.com/interface/>`_.


The sound files provides by this portion are taken from:

* `Erokia <https://freesound.org/people/Erokia/>`_ at `freesound.org <https://freesound.org>`_.
* `plasterbrain <https://freesound.org/people/plasterbrain/>`_ at `freesound.org <https://freesound.org>`_.
