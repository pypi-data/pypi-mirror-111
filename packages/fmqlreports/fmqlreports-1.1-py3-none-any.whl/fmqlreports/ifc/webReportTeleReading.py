TODO 1: Markup
- local ac config broken
- local resolution too
- http://localhost:9100/schema#8925_91 ... external data link and images in FILER side? for TELER?

TODO 2: Grabber Viola (668, 692, 531 (seattle does some DERM), 653, 687)
-------
before READER side: 'grabber' VIOLA (HOUSTON, VIOLA D -- not POR but others)
- st is all canceled? (is in ROSEBURG)
- need to isolate the grabbers and show those in isolation vs the readers (only lucked out on Viola)
- are viola's signons long for TELER ie/ TELER session duration
- in 663 report, VIOLA is someone setup for READING ... need her title
- do see grabber TeleR usage
- on Reader/Puget side, does Viola appear in Consults as an allocator?

> rem I said Puget (which does nearly all DERM => most TeleR as most TeleR is DERM) doesn't use TELER GUI? And we need to stay clear of this lack of use? Well that's true iff use == lock. It looks like they have one or more clerks who DO use TELER GUI to see work list but than rather than locking, they allocate consults to doctors using some other method. We'll bring out such "work allocators" in our CLIN 3 demo for the week after next.

TODO 2: Report misleading for dominant reading VistAs including from themselves (queue probably bypassed and just do local work) ie/ LOCALs blend.
--------
        - highlight active services up front
        - locals distinguished ... ie/ not just last table in list (+ don't bold names)
        - ACTIVITY: % of LOCAL vs REMOTE
------- <-------- see local ac service table near top and how plays out
- POR 648 and all its DENTISTRY!!! BUT ARE THEY ALL LOCAL? NEED BETTER LOCAL/REMOTE SPLIT ala READER / ACQ split ... ie/ within ACQ -- read locally? [so not really tele?]
- see in table in ac for "REMOTE READER" ... not set as local so 663 DERM is local! Even EYE is ... only a few BOISE appear (ELCYZYN, TIMOTHY E -- he has a lot of TELER sessions though ie/ keeps trying?)
- BOI 531 -- ELCYZYN, TIMOTHY E [97094] reads locally too needs to come out ie/ uses it locally ... see table on top of 4 LOCAL services
  (contrast with WCO where its locals go unused? -- need to note that up top)

TODO MORE:
----------
- reader side report (incoming IFC ie/ filer) ... will tie in with documents <-- big for 663 and 648
- [2006.5831](http://localhost:9100/schema#2006_5831)
- may put queue trigger back in if the behavior is significant
- note if activity (ie/ if active in last year) is used in config section

Report TeleReading and the supporting IFCs, documents and images. Very particular IFC.
Cover [1] both Acquisition and Reader sides (including when they are the same VistA) and
[2] the configuration (files) used in all cases.

ADD BACK NOTE

The client __[Telereader Configurator](https://www.va.gov/vdl/documents/Clinical/Vista_Imaging_Sys/mag_telereader_configuration.pdf)__ sets up the following configuration files that determine how Telereading operates in a VistA. It configures both the __Acquisition Role__ and the __Reader Role__.

BETTER INTERP/CONFIG SETUPs (not even clear to me!):
- what's with Boise stuff? 
- remote service name vs local? ie/ one portland 'remote' "BETIC TELERETINAL IMAGING (PORTL" / 2006.5841 has many local 123.5 service types (where one each per local site like Yakama) 
     ie/ local, per instit service name [many] - global (note remote) service name
<--------- ie need to combine the configs tables ie/ local name (instit + local service name) ------> one service based remote name (per remote VistA as a whole)
- ex/ seems like 2006... Queue only uses more global sounding local service DIABETIC TELERETINAL IMAGING IFC (PORTLAND) for eye care and not all the individual per instit services supported in the system
  <------------ ie/ what does the queue use!!!
  BUT the little EYE of YAK TELE-EYE SCREENING (BOI) IFC is used ... ie/ 
- WANT TO SEE 'unused configs'!!!!!
- BIGGIE: split of 1/2/3 (local:local not IFC) ++ what's the no procedure about 
ie/ CONSISTENT configs to go with other stuff

> A (placer) consult created with the Service name (2005.5841->123.5) results in a (filler) consult with the service name Remote Name in the Remote Reading Site ... 2005.5841 also decides how entry is triggered. 

============================= TODO: Content =====================

TODO: [1] fin ac [2] finish Reader Side (align consults) + [3] HL7 vs RPC + [4] neaten/finish final rep form <------ gives new template
- the biggie is FILLER: extrapolate a list as if there is a config file for "filler reading services" ... => 
- need PUG [only internal]
- combine table better ie/ see 2006.5841 ac service -- bring in its Remote Reading Site ie/ show combination.
- RPCs/HL7 attribution and code paths (static report/table) ... see below ie/ BEYOND what data shows unless there is HL7 logs?
  - telereader use lower in SPO (only Eye) but COS consistent with all remote using it!
  - MAY REWORK USER TABLE into 'roles' based on transitions AND not the one summary in queue (who is a reader? responsible? no? ...)
- [FINAL FORM] <-------------- when done beyond freps mv, note IFC in general context + TYPER use rework as neater (not lot's of random types.) MAY DO TYPER explicitly within here ie/ don't run through front end => no need to do custom there ... build in reframe to report.

TODO WORK comments RPCs and HL7 attribution (see code etc comments in reportIFC)

    local acquisitions (ifc_role NONE). All of its consults have ifc_role
    F:FILLER which points to it being a remote reader for another site, one
    that should NOT be in 2006.5841. This can only be known by examining the
    consults of a service and excluding services from acquisition that are
    F:FILLER.
    
    Note that so far, don't see any mixed situations ie/ remote site treats
    a Local Service as its remote Reader AND the site does so itself too ie.
    2006.5841 is valid but the service is doing double duty.
