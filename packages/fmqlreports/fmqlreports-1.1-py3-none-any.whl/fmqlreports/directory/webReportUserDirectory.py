QUICK TODO: 
- reorder the render of user totals in time series (last graph) so biggest appears first ie/ key has PUG, POR ... colNameById needs to be ordered

Goal for directories in general - user ala patient with one, move id checks there but
first need to see what's there now. Federated Directory => mismatch possible, dup,
possible

REM: want ALL User (and Patient?) fixed up and cleaned up (individ and dir) by Labor Day
[one of three key areas inc IFC/TeleR + Data Shape/Sizes]

TODO: and in parallel, improve and make visuals generic
- [ ] make clear the time span of the individual vista (ie/ cut date!) --- want one cut date for directory ie/ cut off all to time of oldest VistA
- [ ] remote vs local user! KEY! --- feeds WWW etc mostly elsewhere (all 4!)
  ... correlate with patients in all? get into 'scatters?'
  (want the "user gone by Labor day")
- [ ] secid growing user (new dups etc) ... "SECID-use" issue! ... 
- [ ] term/demise (user and patient (more))
- [ ] FIX to end date of earliest for data ... as don't want SPO (with extra month) over POR etc in 2020. Leave start date as is.
- [ ] look on graphs -- | black on X and Y axes so clearer
- [ ] Link VISN 20 (VISN 20 https://www.va.gov/directory/guide/region.asp?ID=1020) Directories -- shared care across hospitals and clinics ie/ can treat as unit! ... ALSO may find some are more stand-alone (anchrorage doesn't matter? ... gotta see visits froms)
- New Plot
  - [ ] Scatter Plot use ---> Demise vs Patients added per month ie/ two tracked
  - [ ] Patient age at addition -- does this vary? [age of live patients at cut time]
  (see scatter: https://towardsdatascience.com/5-amazing-tips-for-data-visualization-990fdb19c396)
- [I] time series left
  - "ALL" total ie/ first date of any user
    ... change to serialize CSV at same time in directory using 
  <----- doing user/ seems to make sense but make sure ... main place is totals (NEED TO LOOK INTO IF TRULY NEW ETC ... ie/ DO THE TELEREADER ONLY DIRECTORY USER REPORT and then get back to this)
- [ ] go back to two first months of year for dir as three doesn't stand out right ???
- [ ] BIG And KEY -- HOME PATIENT, HOME USER <---- tell how ... do a pass alg ie/ user => created explicitly
- [user only] no creator vs creator [Auto Entry Addition] ... telling on 2006 or 2019? --- interplay with TERMINATION (a lot a lot in Portland ie/ show contrast)
- [user + patient] 'term' and 'demise' ...
- missing date fill in ie/ evens (got in Patient, add to User and must graph records w/o - extrapolate by surroundings? ie/ guessed date) ---- really only a Patient Problem (seems mainly ok for user)
- automate start-end off VistA image start end (and better doc in md) ie/ automate the ranges (put into dir entries?) ... fix rogues?
  REM: por, www oldest at 3/25 => why do feb back ... cut time series back to there too
  [means for report can handle rolling start-end]
- Variation: Registration Time Delay for studies ie/ 1 patients registered due to studies and two, delay! [studyId, studyDay, patient create day acq, patient create day read] ie/ gets to Patient being in > 1 system and how they get there!

[Context: want fuller Sankey for IFC, TeleR completed in this time frame too]

TODO  NEXT: bigger
- BETTER SPLIT of PATIENT/ USER vs records with fan out of patient, user (first created somewhere) to various systems. ie/ pitch is normalized with (in case of user) 'wasteful'
VistA copies. IE/ FEDERATED DIRECTORIES have issues ... - records flow to ... first
user or patient.
- patient and why ... for IFC? for appt? ie/ what's the trigger?
- feed directory reports back into individual system reports

DF Start
(will move to own utils)

A FOLLOW DIRECTLY: https://medium.com/li-ting-liao-tiffany/solving-real-world-business-questions-with-pandas-70ef8ef02675
... see all the techniques and trade offs 
ie/ cleaning, grouping etc and then compare to Typer

Basic DF to Typer:
- col per subTypeId (fixed value) + one other col with variable values
  ie/ <=> groupby?
  ... many individually grouped by
=> N DF's based on # of props + extra for create as "dayOfWeekCreated" etc.
(do first on Placer Consults -- see notes)

DF for all data exercise (perhaps enum -> C: only, timestamp down?, )
- Basic DF exercise --- how big would a straight up loading of rows get? (count of mults)
  ... load all
  ... ts.memory_usage(deep=True)
  ... idea of "store as a categorical!" ie/ enum of values elsewhere and ref with int ... may be better ... ie/ often "object" -> "category" ts2['name'].astype('category')
see: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/scale.html

DF default reports and plotting <----------- KEY
  
Typer Improve Goals too:
... rem: context is byType grouping that doesn't loose granularity ie/ it's already
a pre-grouping. When going to pandas, gotta work out what I want to see in pandas.
ex/ if all by service of IFC => one service value and could see range of that etc ...
- byValueCount --- just put straight ie/ {}
- use __ for all meta including __count etc
- date inline too and all others?
- byHour option to go with byDay, byMonth, byYear + Day of Week (sample rate)
- option to reference off to labels for pters => if used in subtypes over all over!
      ... 200 ref efficiency ie/ label out ... may do just for it for now (and can expand those types) ... ie/ only 200 at start as others could balloon ... then do others if # lvalues << # asserts ... do comparison 
        ... will need big code change! ie/ do see 200- and then ...
        ... also need a convert new to old type if need be ... [util so no need to regen all]
... _ _count ala _subTypeId
- want the setup options (date time granularty etc to be obvious up front (and drive pandas?) and have a separate .info option?
- import to pandas option (and can see pandas data usage using nvy_df.info)

Takes result of directory.dumpTimeSeriesData() into a DataFrame

https://medium.com/sfu-cspmp/advanced-visualization-for-data-scientists-with-matplotlib-15c28863c41c (see techniques)

FIRST:
======
ie/ df aggregation into a column ala when I combine sts ... if I do a column per criteria and have their vals (subtypeid) and then row each for values 
... then can recombine

> df = df[['PID', 'YEAR_BUILT']].groupby('YEAR_BUILT', as_index = False).count().astype('int').rename(columns = {'PID':'No_of_properties_built'})

and

> df = df[(df['YEAR_BUILT'] >= 1900) & (df['YEAR_BUILT'] <= 2018)]

Look into https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34193862/pandas-pivot-table-list-of-aggfunc
with aggfunc for stats and the pivottable (explained!)

SECOND:
=======
- typer to df 
https://medium.com/well-red/cleaning-a-messy-dataset-using-python-7d7ab0bf199b
... along with subtype id to rows as flatten into rows ... also will drop optionals? as typing not strict OR must populate a default or "N:NONE" for catags
- use other cleans like normalize catag names USA, united states unify ... ie/ df.py (do my own df utils (mainly tips til get routines)

Could have used JSON ...

df = pd.DataFrame({'Date': [day1, day2 ...],
                   '668': [cnt day 1, cnt day2, ...],
                   '663' ...
                   })

or DataFrame({...}, [dates as index])                   

vs CSV form

    Date,668,663,648,687
    1979-02-13,0,0,1,0
    ...
    
https://hackingandslacking.com/plotting-data-with-seaborn-and-pandas-d2499fdf6f01 <---- good on "cleanup CSV pandas" and objects [if doing own typing]
    
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_markdown.html includes markdown serialization

TODO: 
- https://towardsdatascience.com/pyviz-simplifying-the-data-visualisation-process-in-python-1b6d2cb728f1 <------ pandas built in "visuals" ... max/min etc. ie/ just working the
dataframes before going to deeper graphs

- https://tryolabs.com/blog/2017/03/16/pandas-seaborn-a-guide-to-handle-visualize-data-elegantly/ ... see groups columns etc

Other options to look at: (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html)
- if no names are passed the behavior is identical to header=0 and column names are inferred from the first line of the file
- squeeze: If the parsed data only contains one column then return a Series. (TODO: using a series)

Note: if want CSV inline then use StringIO
    pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(data))
where data is string CSV

Can just make a DF with explicit Index (column) and other columns ...
