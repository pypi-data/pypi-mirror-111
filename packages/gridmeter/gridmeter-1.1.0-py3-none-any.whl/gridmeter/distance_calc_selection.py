    Parameters
    ----------
    treatment_group: pd.DataFrame
        A dataframe representing treatment group meters, indexed by id, with each column being a data point in a usage pattern.
    comparison_pool: pd.DataFrame
        A dataframe representing comparison pool meters, indexed by id, with each column being a data point in a usage pattern.
    weights: list
        A list of floats (must be of length of the treatment group columns) to scale the usage patterns in order to ensure that certain components of usage have higher weights towards matching than others.
    n_treatments_per_chunk: int
        Due to local memory limitations, treatment meters can be chunked so that the cdist calculation can happen in memory. 10,000 meters appear to be sufficient for most memory constraints.
