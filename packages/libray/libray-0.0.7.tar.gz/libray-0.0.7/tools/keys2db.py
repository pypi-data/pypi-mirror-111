# This script transforms Datfile.dat and keys/*.key keyfiles into a sqlite3 keys.db
# Keys.db is then moved to libray/data/keys.db and packaged with libray in setup.py.
# Libray checks if this file is bundled with it and checks if it has a key for the .iso using a crc32 of it.
# TODO: In theory we could add the game-serials (BLUS-0000) and check that first.
