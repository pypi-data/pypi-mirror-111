Description: # explore_lif
        
        Load 3D confocal images from `lif` files as `numpy` arrays.
        
        ## Install
        
        - The most convenient way would be: `pip install -e .` from the directory where you have cloned or downloaded the code.
        - You can also Include the file `explore_lif` in your project directory
        
        ## How to Use It
        
        ### For 3D Image
        
        ```python
        from explore_lif import Reader
        
        reader = Reader('lif_file.lif')
        series = reader.getSeries()
        chosen = series[0]  # choose first image in the lif file
        # get a numpy array corresponding to the 1st time point & 1st channel
        # the shape is (x, y, z)
        image = chosen.getXYZ(T=0, channel=0)
        ```
        
        ### For 2D Image with Multiple Channels
        
        ```python
        from explore_lif import Reader
        
        reader = Reader('lif_file.lif')
        series = reader.getSeries()
        chosen = series[0]  # choose first image in the lif file
        # get a numpy array corresponding to the 1st time point
        # the shape is (x, y, channel_number)
        image = chosen.getXYC(T=0)
        ```
