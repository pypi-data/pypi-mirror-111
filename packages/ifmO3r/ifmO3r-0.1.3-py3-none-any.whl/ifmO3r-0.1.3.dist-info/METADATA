## New python environment

To get the best experience, we recommend to use a blank python environment. There are several tools like the built in `venv`(python >= 3.2), `virtualvenv` with more features or even `anaconda` to create these virtual environments. Using `venv` you can do following:
  `python -m venv [path/name_of_venv]`
Now you can choose to either use the local, wheel or pip installation.

## 3D viewer

The 3D viewer is also a package on PyPI. You can install the 3D viewer by `pip install ifmO3rViewer`
