0.8.0 (2021-07-02)
------------------

* TCP communication protocol.
* Lauda PRO RP 245 E circulation thermostat device over TCP.
* Pico Technology PT-104 Platinum Resistance Data Logger device as a wrapper of the
  Python bindings for the PicoSDK.
* In :code:`com.visa.VisaCommunication`: periodic status polling when VISA/TCP keep
  alive connection is not supported by a host.

0.7.1 (2021-06-04)
------------------

* New :code:`utils.validation` submodule with :code:`validate_bool` and
  :code:`validate_number` utilities extracted from internal use within a
  :code:`dev.tiepie` subpackage.
* In :code:`comm.serial.SerialCommunication`:
     * strict encoding errors handling strategy for subclasses,
     * user warning for a low communication timeout value.

0.7.0 (2021-05-25)
------------------

* The :code:`dev.tiepie` module was splitted into a subpackage with, in particular,
  submodules for each of the device types -- :code:`oscilloscope`, :code:`generator`,
  and :code:`i2c` -- and with backward-incompatible direct imports from the submodules.
* In :code:`dev.technix`:
      * fixed communication crash on nested status byte query;
      * added enums for GET and SET register commands.
* Further minor logging improvements: added missing module level logger and removed some
  error logs in :code:`except` blocks used for a flow control.
* In :code:`examples/` folder renamed consistently all the examples.
* In API documentation: fix incorrect links mapping on inheritance diagrams.

0.6.1 (2021-05-08)
------------------

* In :code:`dev.tiepie`:
      * dynamically set oscilloscope's channel limits in
        :code:`OscilloscopeChannelParameterLimits`: :code:`input_range` and
        :code:`trigger_level_abs`, incl. update of latter on each change of
        :code:`input_range` value of a :code:`TiePieOscilloscopeChannelConfig`
        instances;
      * quick fix for opening of combined instruments by disabling
        :code:`OscilloscopeParameterLimits.trigger_delay` (an advanced feature);
      * enable automatic devices detection to be able to find network devices with
        :code:`TiePieOscilloscope.list_devices()`.
* Fix :code:`examples/example_labjack.py`.
* Improved logging: consistently use module level loggers, and always log exception
  tracebacks.
* Improve API documentation: separate pages per modules, each with an inheritance
  diagram as an overview.

0.6.0 (2021-04-23)
------------------

* Technix capacitor charger using either serial connection or Telnet protocol.
* Extensions, improvements and fixes in existing devices:
   * In :code:`dev.tiepie.TiePieOscilloscope`:
       * redesigned measurement start and data collection API, incl. time out
         argument, with no/infinite time out option;
       * trigger allows now a no/infinite time out;
       * record length and trigger level were fixed to accept, respectively, floating
         point and integer numbers;
       * fixed resolution validation bug;
   * :code:`dev.heinzinger.HeinzingerDI` and `dev.rs_rto1024.RTO1024` instances are now
     resilient to multiple :code:`stop()` calls.
   * In :code:`dev.crylas.CryLasLaser`: default configuration timeout and
     polling period were adjusted;
   * Fixed PSI9080 example script.
* Package and source code improvements:
   * Update to backward-incompatible :code:`pyvisa-py>=0.5.2`. Developers, do update
     your local development environments!
   * External libraries, like LibTiePie SDK or LJM Library, are now not installed by
     default; they are now extra installation options.
   * Added Python 3.9 support.
   * Improved number formatting in logs.
   * Typing improvements and fixes for :code:`mypy>=0.800`.

0.5.0 (2020-11-11)
------------------

* TiePie USB oscilloscope, generator and I2C host devices, as a wrapper of the Python
  bindings for the LibTiePie SDK.
* a FuG Elektronik Power Supply (e.g. Capacitor Charger HCK) using the built-in ADDAT
  controller with the Probus V protocol over a serial connection
* All devices poling status or measurements use now a :code:`dev.utils.Poller` utility
  class.
* Extensions and improvements in existing devices:
    * In :code:`dev.rs_rto1024.RTO1024`: added Channel state, scale, range,
      position and offset accessors, and measurements activation and read methods.
    * In :code:`dev.sst_luminox.Luminox`: added querying for all measurements
      in polling mode, and made output mode activation more robust.
    * In :code:`dev.newport.NewportSMC100PP`: an error-prone
      :code:`wait_until_move_finished` method of replaced by a fixed waiting time,
      device operations are now robust to a power supply cut, and device restart is not
      required to apply a start configuration.
* Other minor improvements:
    * Single failure-safe starting and stopping of devices sequenced via
      :code:`dev.base.DeviceSequenceMixin`.
    * Moved :code:`read_text_nonempty` up to :code:`comm.serial.SerialCommunication`.
    * Added development Dockerfile.
    * Updated package and development dependencies: :code:`pymodbus`,
      :code:`pytest-mock`.
