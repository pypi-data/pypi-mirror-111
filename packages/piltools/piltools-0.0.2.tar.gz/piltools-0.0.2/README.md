## Python Imaging Library Tools

Pillow is "[the friendly PIL fork by Alex Clark and Contributors](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)".

This tool suite is meant to augment the existing Python Imaging Library with the following tools:
- Recrop: A dynamic image resizer. Given a target (width, height) dimension, resize the image, then crop with respect to a focus area.
- (More tools to come)
