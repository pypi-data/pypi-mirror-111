## Typing stubs for Pillow

This is an auto-generated PEP 561 type stub package for `Pillow` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `Pillow`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/Pillow. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

This package was generated from typeshed commit `2b64f54008f6dbaded7970336e26c4f02fa82fd9`.
