# Pwea 

Pwea is a simple weather tool written in Python, utilizing the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to source current weather information.

Pwea uses the [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) libraries to retrieve and display weather data.

# How it works

Pass a desired location to `pwea` to retrieve the current weather information. For forecast information, add `-t forecast` or `--type forecast`. For imperial measurements, use `-u imperial` or `--unit imperial`

Use it like this:

`pwea springfield MA`

`git clone https://gitlab.com/jeffreybarfield/pwea.git`
